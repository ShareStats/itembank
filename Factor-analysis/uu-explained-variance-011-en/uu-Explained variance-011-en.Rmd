Question
========
A study of internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors (X1 through X5) in rural youth resulted in the following correlation matrix:

An unrotated principal component analysis yielded the following factor loading matrix for a two-factor solution:

What percentage of the variance in the five behaviors is explained by the first factor?

Answerlist
----------
* Less than 50%
* Between 50% and 68%
* Between 68% and 75%
* More than 5%


Solution
========


Explanation: This question asks first about Eigenvalue 
$\lambda$ of Factor 1. To calculate it, use the following formula: $\lambda =  \sum a^2_{gt}$ . We fill these in with the factor loadings on Factor 1: 

$\lambda = .67^2 + .63^2 + .76^2 + .67^2 + .72^2 = .449+ .397 + .578 + .449 + .518 = 2.391$
This is then divided by the number of items to calculate the explained variance of Factor 1: $\frac {\lambda} {k} \frac {2.391}{5} = .478.$
Factor 1 explained 47.8% of the variance of the items.
