Question
========
  
In a higher-order principal component analysis of ten tests, the researcher finally adopted a two-factor solution. The Eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of the Factor 1 is 4.1 and the Eigenvalue $\lambda_2$ of Factor 2 is 1.3.

Apply the following criteria for qualitative assessment of the factor solution:

- Explained variance lower than 30%: poor
- Explained variance between 30% - 50%: moderate
- Explained variance higher than 50%: good

Based on explained variance and the above criteria, how do you rate the two-factor solution?


Answerlist
----------
* As good because the explained variance is higher than 50%.
* As moderate because the explained variance is between 30% and 50%.
* As poor because the explained variance is below 30%.
* We cannot make a valid statement about quality with the data provided.


Solution
========
  
Explanation: In the explanation, it is given that 10 variables were included in this factor analysis. This means that the maximum Eigenvalue is equal to 10.00 (with full overlap of the factor with all variables). A factor with an Eigenvalue of 4.1, thus explains 41% (4.1 / 10.0) of the total variance. Since no oblique rotation was applied in this example, the factors have no overlap. For this reason, the following calculation can be used to calculate the explained variance of the factors:

4.1/10.0 + 1.3/ 10.0 = .41 + .13 = .54

In total, as much as 54% of the variance is explained by the two factors.
