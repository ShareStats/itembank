Question
========
* Ork for psychologists and educators.*

A scientist is investigating factors that may explain why career opportunities for psychologists and educators are sometimes low. From theoretical insights about career opportunities, the researcher has the idea that several dimensions can be distinguished that have something to do with career opportunities. She has devised 34 statements on which respondents can indicate whether they agree with a statement on a 4-point scale (1. completely agree; 2. somewhat agree; 3. not so much agree; 4. not at all agree). An example of a statement is, "I completed a relevant internship during my education." The questionnaire was administered to 312 graduates. Participants' responses to the 34 statements are shown in the data file.

Open the data file.

Perform an unrotated exploratory factor analysis with principal axis factoring in which you include all the statements from the questionnaire. What percentage of the total variance does the third factor explain (1 decimal place)?
