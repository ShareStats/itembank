Question
========
  
Hedonists turn into altruists when they have children of their own. An empirical study of this expectation requires the development of an altruism-hedonism measurement tool.

Evaluate the following two statements on a factor analysis of a collection of items for the altruism-hedonism scale.

I. Using the Eigenvalue greater than 1 criterion, select a set of factors based on a content criterion.

II. After rotation of factors, interpretation of the factors usually becomes considerably more difficult than before rotation.


  
Answerlist
----------
* Pronunciation I and II are both correct.
* Only pronunciation I is correct.
* Only pronunciation II is correct.
* Pronunciation I and II are both incorrect.


Solution
========
  
Explanation:

Theorem 1: The eigenvalue criterion is a statistical criterion. It looks at statistical data without considering the content of the items or an expected number of factors.

Theorem 2: Rotation of the factors precisely aims to make the items load more strongly on the factors, which will make the interpretation of the factors (significantly) easier.
