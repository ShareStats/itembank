Question
========
After performing a factor analysis, the goal is often to find simple structure. What does “ simple structure” mean, and why do researchers strive for simple structure?


Solution
========
Simple structure means that items in particular load high on one factor and low on others. Simple structure can be checked in the structure and pattern matrices in which you expect high loadings at only one factor. Simple structure is preferred because it enhances the interpretability of the factors and the items.
