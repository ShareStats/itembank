Question
========
  
In the study The Boundless Youth, a questionnaire was administered to a random sample of over 500 young people between the ages of 12 and 25. The following eight personality characteristics were operationalized: narcissism, materialism, social involvement, hedonism, self-centeredness, altruism, self-reliance, and last but not least, crazy-in-your-head.

Over the test scores, the researchers plan to conduct an exploratory higher-order factor analysis (PAF) with orthogonal rotation. The researchers request a consultation with an expert in factor analysis. They submit the following two statements to the expert.

I. The Eigenvalue of a factor is the percentage of variance in test scores explained by that factor. II. No correlation between factors (axes) is possible after orthogonal rotation.
