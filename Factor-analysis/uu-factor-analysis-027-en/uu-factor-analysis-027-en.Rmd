Would you reduce the number of factors based on the information in the output? 
Answerlist
----------
* Yes, because only 1 item loads very high on factor 3 and the kink in the screeplot is above 2
* Yes, because the factors have negative loadings and the Eigenvalues are small
* No, because the explained variance with three factors is good and the pattern matrix shows 3 factors
* No, because the interfactor correlations are too small to start reducing
