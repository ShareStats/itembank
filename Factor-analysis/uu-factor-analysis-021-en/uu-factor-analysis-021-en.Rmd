Question
========
  
Marlies is writing the results section of her Bachelor thesis. She has investigated how environmentally conscious people are. She did this using a short questionnaire consisting of 7 statements of which people could indicate to what extent they agreed or disagreed with such a statement on a 5-point Likert scale.  Marlies collected data among 125 men and women in the Utrecht region. In this part of her analysis, she wants to see if her questionnaire is valid. To do this she performs a factor analysis, parts of the results of which are given below.
