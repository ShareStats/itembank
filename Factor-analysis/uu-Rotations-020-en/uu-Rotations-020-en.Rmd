Marlies is writing the results section of her Bachelor thesis. She has investigated how environmentally conscious people are. She did this using a short questionnaire consisting of 7 statements of which people could indicate to what extent they agreed or disagreed with such a statement on a 5-point Likert scale.

* Because they expect to find three scales
