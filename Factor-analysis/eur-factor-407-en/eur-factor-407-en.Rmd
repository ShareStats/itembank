Question
========
A researcher working at the psychology institute investigates alcohol abuse among adolescents. The researcher designed 34 statements the adolescents can agree or disagree with on a four-point scale (1 = completely agree; 2 = somewhat agree; 3 = somewhat disagree; 4 = completely disagree). An example of a statement is: When I feel lonely, I enjoy drinking an alcoholic beverage. The answers of 312 girls (0) and boys (1) to the 34 statements are in the dataset. 

When 4 factors are extracted by principal axis factoring, what is the percentage of the variance (extracted sums of squared loadings) that is explained by the 4 factors combined? (3 decimals)

Solution
========
The percentage of variance explained by the four factors combined is 21.604% (look for the extraction sums of squared loadings and then the cumulative %).
