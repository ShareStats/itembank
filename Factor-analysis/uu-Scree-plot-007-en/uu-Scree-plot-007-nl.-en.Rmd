Question
========
Below is the scree-plot of a principal component analysis for a ten-item scale on eating problems.

![](uu-Scree-plot-007-nl-tabel.jpg)
How many factors would you choose based on the scree plot?  

Answerlist
----------
* 1 factor
* 2 factors
* 3 factors
* 4 factors

Solution
========
  
We use the scree-plot to look for the transition between the first number of factors that explain a lot of variance and the factors that come after that all explain about the same amount of variance. We then choose the number of factors that lie before/above the first kink in the figure.

In this figure, based on the kink criterion, we choose 2 factors (see the additional line drawn in the figure).
