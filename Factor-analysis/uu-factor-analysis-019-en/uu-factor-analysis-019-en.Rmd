Answerlist
----------
* Based on the percentage of variance explained, we would choose 1 factor, because 31.7% is already a good portion of the variance explained.
* Based on the factor loadings, we would choose two factors, because there is 1 item loading on 2 factors, so the two should be combined.
* Using the interfactor correlations, we would choose 3 factors, because none of the correlations squared indicate a moderate or strong relationship.
* Using the scree plot, we would choose two factors because the kink is above 2.
