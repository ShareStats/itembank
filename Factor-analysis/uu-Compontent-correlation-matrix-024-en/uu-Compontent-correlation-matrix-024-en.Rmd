Question
========

A group of researchers want to develop an instrument that measures how traumatized children are after experiencing a car accident. Based on existing trauma literature, they created items belonging to one of the following scales: re-experiencing, avoidance, arousal, and sleep problems. Because the children themselves are too traumatized, they are taking their 36 items from 314 parents.  Because the researchers expect four subscales, they conduct a factor analysis with 4 factors. Part of the SPSS output is below.

How many factors would you reduce to based on the factor correlations?
Answerlist
----------
* To 1 factor because all factors are strongly correlated with each other
* I would not reduce further because all correlations are weak to moderate
* To 2 factors because factors 1, 2 and 3 are too strongly correlated to form 1 factor, and factor 4 does stand alone
* To 3 factors because factors 1 and 3 and factors 2 and 3 are too strongly correlated and therefore become 1 factor, and factor 1 and 4 are not really correlated with the other factors

Solution
========

Up to 2 factors is the correct answer.
