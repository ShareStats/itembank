Question
========
  
A group of researchers want to develop an instrument that measures how traumatized children are after experiencing a car accident. Based on existing trauma literature, they created items belonging to one of the following scales: re-experiencing, avoidance, arousal, and sleep problems. Because the children themselves are too traumatized, they are taking their 36 items from 314 parents.  Because the researchers expect four subscales, they conduct a factor analysis with 4 factors. Part of the SPSS output is below.
