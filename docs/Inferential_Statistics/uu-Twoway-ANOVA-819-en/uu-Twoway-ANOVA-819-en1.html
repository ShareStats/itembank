<h4>Question</h4>

<p>The grades of a group of students in the Statistics I course at a Boston university is used to answer the question of whether grade for this course depends on subject of study (major) and sex (gender).</p>
<p>The researchers randomly selected the students from course files. Closer inspection reveals that there are several students in the sample who have a double major. The grades of a few students are listed under both Social Science and Languages. The grades of two more students are listed under both Econ/Political Science and Languages.</p>
<p>Which condition of the two-way ANOVA did the researchers violate with this?</p>
<br/>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<b>FALSE:</b> Random sample
</li>
<li>
<b>TRUE:</b> Independence of observations
</li>
<li>
<b>FALSE:</b> Equal variances
</li>
<li>
<b>FALSE:</b> Normal distribution of numbers
</li>
</ol>
<br/>

<ol type="a">
<li>
Random sample. This condition is not violated, since a random sample was drawn, or a random sample
</li>
<li>
Independence of observations. This condition is violated because there are students who are in more than 1 of the groups. It is important in an ANOVA that there are independent groups. This is not the case.
</li>
<li>
Equal variances. This condition is an important one in this test, but this is not what the question is about.
</li>
<li>
Normal distribution of numbers.This condition is an important one with this test, but this is not what the question is about.
