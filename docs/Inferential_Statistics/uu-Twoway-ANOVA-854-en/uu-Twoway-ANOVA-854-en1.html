<h4>Question</h4>

<p>A group of researchers looks at the effect of gender and whether or not a smiley-face is applied on accounts and average tip percentage. The researchers suggest including the following sentence in the research paper:</p>
<p>The study finds that there are no significant differences in average tip percentages between accounts with a smiley face and those without a smiley face, F = 2, p = .135.</p>
<p>Are the researchers correct to report this? Why or why not?</p>
<br/>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<b>FALSE:</b> Yes, because the p-value is greater than 0.05 and then no difference is present and it is not important to look further
</li>
<li>
<b>FALSE:</b> Yes, because the interaction effect results are significant and so there are no differences between the waiters and waitresses
</li>
<li>
<b>FALSE:</b> No, because the F value is equal to 2, and that is almost equal to 1 and then we cannot draw reliable conclusions about whether or not there are differences between the accounts with and the accounts without smiley-face
</li>
<li>
<b>TRUE:</b> No, because she has to look at the interaction effect first, and it turns out that there are differences between the accounts with a smiley-face and those without, but only within the two gender groups
