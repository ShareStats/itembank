<h4>Question</h4>

<p>A researcher wants to test whether the proportion of Dutch students who
have ever used cannabis is higher than 20%. The alternative hypothesis
of the researcher is therefore as follows: H<sub>a</sub>: π &gt; 0.20.
The observed proportion in the mentioned sample (n = 150) is 0.24.</p>
<p>The researcher uses a significance level of 5% (alpha = 0.05).</p>
<p>Is the null hypothesis H0 rejected in this study?</p>
<br/>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<b>FALSE:</b> Yes, because there is sufficient empirical evidence to assume that the proportion of Dutch students who have ever used cannabis is higher than 0.20.
</li>
<li>
<b>FALSE:</b> Yes, because there is not enough empirical evidence to assume that the proportion of Dutch pupils who have ever used cannabis is higher than 0.20.
</li>
<li>
<b>FALSE:</b> No, because there is sufficient empirical evidence to assume that the proportion of Dutch students who have ever used cannabis is higher than 0.20.
</li>
<li>
<b>TRUE:</b> No, because there is not enough empirical evidence to assume that the proportion of Dutch school students who ever used cannabis is higher than 0.20.
</li>
</ol>
<br/>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>The true answer is: No, because there is not enough empirical evidence
to assume that the proportion of Dutch pupils who ever used cannabis is
higher than 0.20.</p>
<p>The alternative hypothesis is that the mean is higher than 0.2 and we
found a proportion of 0.24. However,</p>
<p>Compute the standard error (se) of the sampling distribution. se =
sqrt[ P * ( 1 - P ) / n ]<br />
where P is the hypothesized value of population proportion in the null
hypothesis, and n is the sample size.</p>
<p>For this example: σ = sqrt[ P * ( 1 - P ) / n ] = sqrt
(0.2)(0.8)/150=0.033</p>
<p>The test statistic is a z-score (z) defined by the following equation: z
= (p - P) / se<br />
where P is the hypothesized value of population proportion in the null
hypothesis, p is the sample proportion, and se is the standard deviation
of the sampling distribution.<br />
z = (0.24-0.20)/0.033=1.22</p>
<p>The critical value (one tailed) is 1.64.</p>
<p>Because 1.22 is smaller than 1.64 there is not enough evidence.</p>
