<h4>Question</h4>

<p>A study of conflict resolution (Y) in adolescents measures extraversion (X) and examines the level of aggression (M). It is examined whether M is a mediator. One does two steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>regression with Y as dependent and X as independent variable. (2) regression with M as dependent and X as independent variable.</li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming significant results in steps (1) and (2), what is the next step?</p>
<br/>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<b>FALSE:</b> Regression with Y and M as independent variables and X as dependent.
</li>
<li>
<b>FALSE:</b> Regression with X and Y as independent variables and M as dependent.
</li>
<li>
<b>TRUE:</b> Regression with X and M as independent variables and Y as dependent.
</li>
<li>
<b>FALSE:</b> Regression with Y as independent variable and X as dependent.
</li>
</ol>
<br/>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>To test mediation, we examine the following four steps: 1. Is there a significant relationship between X and Y? 2. Is there a significant relationship between X and M? 3. Is there a significant relationship between M and Y, when controlling for M? 4. Is the relationship between X and Y still significant, when controlling for M?</p>
<p>Steps 1 and 2 have been undertaken. The next step is to do a regression analysis with X and M as independent variables and Y as dependent. The results of this analysis can be used for both Step 3 and Step 4.</p>
