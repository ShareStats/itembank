========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 13, mean = 44, sd = 9.8. Sample 2: n = 17, mean = 36, sd = 8.06. The pooled variance estimator takes the value 78.28. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
