Question
========

A game is played with a spinner on a circle, like a hand of a clock constantly driven by a motor. The circle is divided evenly into segments numbered 1 through 100. The player spins the spinner and the resulting number is the time (in seconds) given to the player to answer a question. Suppose the uniform random variable *X* is the player's amount of time. What is the probability of *P*(40 ≤ X ≤ 15)?
