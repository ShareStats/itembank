Question
========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 12, mean = 51, sd = 11.46 Sample 2: n = 19, mean = 34, sd = 9.28. The pooled variance estimator takes the value 103.27. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
