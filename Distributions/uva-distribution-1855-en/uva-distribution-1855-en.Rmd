Question
========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 19, mean = 38, sd = 3.03 Sample 2: n = 11, mean = 31, sd = 11.82. The pooled variance estimator takes the value 55.8. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
