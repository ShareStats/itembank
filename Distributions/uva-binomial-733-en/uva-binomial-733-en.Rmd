Question
========

Vase I contains nine red balls and one white ball. Vase II contains six red and four white balls. We repeat 20 times in a row the following experiment:

1.  First, throw a pure die. 2.  If the number of eyes is divisible by three, randomly choose a ball from vase I. Otherwise, randomly pick a ball from vase II.

After each repetition, the selected ball is returned to the vase from which it was taken. from which it was taken.Ê \ Which of the following statements is correct?

Answerlist
----------

* The number of red balls chosen is binomially distributed with n=20 and p=0.90.
* The number of red balls chosen is binomially distributed with n=20 and p=0.60.
* The number of red balls chosen is binomially distributed with n=20 and p=0.75.
* The number of red balls chosen is binomially distributed with n=20 and p=0.70.
* The probability distribution of the number of red balls chosen is not a binomial distribution at all.
