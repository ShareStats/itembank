Question
========

Genetics teaches that children inherit genes from their parents. If both parents carry the genes O and A for blood type, each child has a chance of 0.25 to inherit two O genes to become blood type O. The number of children with blood type O among five offspring of these parents is the number of successes *X* in five independent attempts. Suppose that random variable X is the number of children with blood type O, so *X* has the values as 0, 1, TRUE. , 5 and the *Binomial* (5, 0.25)-distribution. Which diagram below shows the probability of each value of *X*?
