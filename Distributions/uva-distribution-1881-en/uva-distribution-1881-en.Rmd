========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 12, mean = 39, sd = 9.36 Sample 2: n = 17, mean = 33, sd = 11.67. The pooled variance estimator takes the value 116.4. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
