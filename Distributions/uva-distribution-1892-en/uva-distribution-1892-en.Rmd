========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 11, mean = 56, sd = 12.04 Sample 2: n = 15, mean = 46, sd = 11.84. The pooled variance estimator takes the value 142.18. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
