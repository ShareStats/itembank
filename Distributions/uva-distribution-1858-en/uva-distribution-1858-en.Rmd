Question
========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________________________. Sample 1: n = 14, mean = 43, sd = 12. Sample 2: n = 16, mean = 37, sd = 8.16. The pooled variance estimator takes the value 102.53. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
