Question
========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 14, mean = 49, sd = 8.03 Sample 2: n = 15, mean = 38, sd = 12.76. The pooled variance estimator takes the value 115.47. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
