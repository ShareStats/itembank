Question
========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 12, mean = 34, sd = 8.47 Sample 2: n = 13, mean = 45, sd = 10.88. The pooled variance estimator takes the value of 96.07. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
