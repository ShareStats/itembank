Question
========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 11, mean = 26, sd = 9.35 Sample 2: n = 16, mean = 55, sd = 9.36. The pooled variance estimator takes the value 87.53. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
