========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 19, mean = 34, sd = 12.01 Sample 2: n = 16, mean = 26, sd = 10.58 The pooled variance estimator takes the value 129.56. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
