Question
========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 19, mean = 23, sd = 3.41 Sample 2: n = 13, mean = 45, sd = 7.17. The pooled variance estimator takes the value of 27.54. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
