Question
========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 13, mean = 24, sd = 3.89 Sample 2: n = 19, mean = 47, sd = 10.35. The pooled variance estimator takes the value 70.33. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
