Question
========

You get many outcomes from different generators of coincidence numbers. Suppose that *Y* is a continuous stochastic variable that can have any value between 0 and 1, i.e. 0 ≤ *Y* ≤ 1. The density curve of these outcomes then has a constant height. What is the height of this density curve between 0 and 1?
