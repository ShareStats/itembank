========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 20, mean = 58, sd = 8.9. Sample 2: n = 12, mean = 59, sd = 12.53. The pooled variance estimator takes the value 107.73. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
