Question
========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 14, mean = 43, sd = 8.93 Sample 2: n = 17, mean = 34, sd = 9.61. The pooled variance estimator takes the value 86.7. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
