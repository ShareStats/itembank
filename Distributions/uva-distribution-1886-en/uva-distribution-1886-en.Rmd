Question
========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 17, mean = 47, sd = 4.48 Sample 2: n = 15, mean = 21, sd = 8.36. The pooled variance estimator takes the value of 43.32. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
