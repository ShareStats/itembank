========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 13, mean = 58, sd = 11.05 Sample 2: n = 18, mean = 54, sd = 10.81. The pooled variance estimator takes the value 119.03. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
