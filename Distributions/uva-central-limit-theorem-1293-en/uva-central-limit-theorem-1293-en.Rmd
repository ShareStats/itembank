Question
========

A study of rush-hour traffic in Amsterdam shows the number of persons per vehicle entering a highway. Suppose *X* is the number of persons per vehicle with a mean of 1.5 and a standard deviation of 0.75 in the population.Ã“ A traffic expert estimates the capacity of an on-ramp to be 700 vehicles per hour. Use the Central Limit Theorem. Calculate an approximate the distribution of the average number of people in 700 randomly selected vehicles:

Answerlist
----------

* The distribution has a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 1.

* The distribution has a mean of 1.5 and a standard deviation of 0.75
* The distribution has a mean of 350 and a standard deviation of 700.
