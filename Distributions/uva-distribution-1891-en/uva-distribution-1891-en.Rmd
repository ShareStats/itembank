Question
========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 17, mean = 26, sd = 11.76 Sample 2: n = 17, mean = 50, sd = 7.48. The pooled variance estimator takes the value of 97.12. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
