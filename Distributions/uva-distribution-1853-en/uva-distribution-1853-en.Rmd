========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 19, mean = 46, sd = 12.41 Sample 2: n = 20, mean = 35, sd = 7.5. The pooled variance estimator takes the value 103.81. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
