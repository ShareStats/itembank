From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 16, mean = 43, sd = 5.77 Sample 2: n = 15, mean = 41, sd = 3.31. The pooled variance estimator takes the value 22.51. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
