========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 12, mean = 26, sd = 7.48 Sample 2: n = 15, mean = 57, sd = 8.91. The pooled variance estimator takes the value 69.08. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
