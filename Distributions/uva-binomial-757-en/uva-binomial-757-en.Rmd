Question
========

Genetics teaches that children inherit genes from their parents. If both parents carry the genes O and A for blood type, each child has a chance of 0.25 to inherit two O genes to become blood type O. The number of children with blood type O among five offspring of these parents is the number of successes *X* in five independent attempts. Suppose that random variable *X* is the number of children with blood type O, so *X* has the values as 0, 1, TRUE. , 5 and the Binomial (5, 0.25) distribution. Below is a table about which distribution. What then is the probability if *X* â‰¥ 3?

  ---------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- TRUE of *X* 0 1 2 3 4 5 *chance* 0.2373 0.3955 0.2637 0.0879 0.0146 0.0010 ---------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------
