Question
========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 18, mean = 27, sd = 7.99 Sample 2: n = 14, mean = 44, sd = 10.4. The pooled variance estimator takes the value 83.05. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
