Question
========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 19, mean = 37, sd = 6.01 Sample 2: n = 16, mean = 33, sd = 5.46. The pooled variance estimator takes the value of 33.25. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
