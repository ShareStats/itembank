Question
========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 12, mean = 22, sd = 11.01 Sample 2: n = 12, mean = 46, sd = 4.64. The pooled variance estimator takes the value 71.37. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
