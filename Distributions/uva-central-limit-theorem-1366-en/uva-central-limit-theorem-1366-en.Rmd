Question
========

The pH (acidity) of the liquid is crucial for regulation of the dye absorption in cashmere sweaters. Research shows that the pH in a normal distribution varies with a mean of 4.22 and a standard deviation of 0.127. You will take a random sample of 10 sweaters. What then is the 95% confidence interval of the sample mean?
