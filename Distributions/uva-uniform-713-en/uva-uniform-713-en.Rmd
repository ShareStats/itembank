Question
========

A generator of random numbers in a computer will spread its outcomes spread evenly over the entire interval from 0 to 1 when we make it generate a long series of numbers. We call this a so-called *uniform distribution*. A generator of random numbers produces a number *X* that lies in an interval 0.4 or in an interval 0,7. Which gray shaded area(s) does the probability P(*X* â‰¤ 0.4 or *X* \> 0.7) assign?
