========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 18, mean = 47, sd = 10.81 Sample 2: n = 10, mean = 29, sd = 12.64. The pooled variance estimator takes the value 131.71. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
