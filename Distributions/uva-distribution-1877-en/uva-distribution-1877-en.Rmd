========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 15, mean = 42, sd = 12.37 Sample 2: n = 11, mean = 53, sd = 6.99. The pooled variance estimator takes the value 109.62. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
