From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 15, mean = 32, sd = 6.32 Sample 2: n = 11, mean = 45, sd = 7.49. The pooled variance estimator takes the value 46.67. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
