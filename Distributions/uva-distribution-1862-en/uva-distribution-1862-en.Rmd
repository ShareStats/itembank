========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 19, mean = 45, sd = 9.29 Sample 2: n = 18, mean = 52, sd = 3.8. The pooled variance estimator takes the value 51.4. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
