Question
========

From each of two normally distributed populations with equal variances a sample is drawn.______________. Sample 1: n = 11, mean = 53, sd = 7.66 Sample 2: n = 18, mean = 51, sd = 7.47. The pooled variance estimator takes the value of 56.87. It is tested whether the population averages are equal. The corresponding test size follows, if the null hypothesis is TRUE,
