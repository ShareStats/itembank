Question
========

Research shows that in the event of fraud, only 14% of the students who see it would report it to teachers. The proportion *p*
= 0.14 is a parameter that describes the population of all students. The proportion $\hat{p}$ of the sample is a given in order to *p* estimate in the study and that is a pure estimate. We take a sample of 600 students. Then $\hat{p}$ normally distributed with an expectation of 0.14 and a standard deviation of 0.016. What is the probability that the result of the study will be more than two percentage points different from the true population, i.e., the probability of
$\hat{p}$<0.12 or $\hat{p}$\>0,16?
