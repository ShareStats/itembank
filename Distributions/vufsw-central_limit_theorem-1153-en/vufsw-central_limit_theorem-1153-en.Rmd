Question
========
A researcher wants to know how many glasses of alcohol are consumed on
average per week by Dutch young people aged between 16 and 18 years. A
random sample with 114 youngsters (n=114) yields the following data:  
  
Mean = 6.13  
Standard error = 0.34  
Standard deviation = 3.66  
  
The sample distribution appears to be very skewed to the right. Even
though the sample is not distributed normally, we can draw certain
conclusions because of the Central Limit Theorem. Which of the following
conclusion (s) can we draw?  
  
  
I. The sampling distribution is skewed to the right.  
II. We can predict with high confidence (about 95% certainty) that the
average number of glasses of alcohol consumed per week for all Dutch
youngsters between the ages of 16 and 18 will be approximately between
5.45 (6.13 - 0.68) and 6.81 (6.13 + 0.68).
