Question
========

A game is played with a spinner on a circle, like a hand of a clock constantly driven by a motor. The circle is divided evenly into segments numbered 1 through 100. The player spins the spinner and the resulting number is the time (in seconds) given to the player to answer a question. Suppose the uniform random variable X is the player's amount of time. What is the probability of P(35 ≤ X ≤ 75)?
