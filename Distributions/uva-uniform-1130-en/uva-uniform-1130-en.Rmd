Question
========

A game is played with a spinner on a circle, like a hand of a clock constantly driven by a motor. The circle is divided evenly into segments numbered from ***1 to 100***. The player spins the spinner and the resulting number is the time (in seconds) given to the player to answer a question. Suppose the uniform random variable *X* = the amount of time of the player. Then what is the probability of *P*(X≤ 15)?‖.
