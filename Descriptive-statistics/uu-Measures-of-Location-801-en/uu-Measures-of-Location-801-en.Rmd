Question
========
What happens to the average $\mu$ = 8 and the standard deviation of $$sigma$ = 3 of a population if you multiply the raw scores by a factor of 2 and then add 6 points?


  
Answerlist
----------
* The average will be $\mu$ = 16 and the standard deviation becomes $$sigma$ = 6.
* The mean becomes $\mu$ = 16 and the standard deviation becomes $$sigma$ = 12.
* The mean becomes $\mu$ = 22 and the standard deviation becomes $$sigma$ = 6.
* The mean becomes $\mu$ = 22 and the standard deviation becomes $\sigma$ = 12.
