Question
========
  
See table below. A study examined differences in income among three ethnic groups in the United States (N = 80). The independent variable race had three levels: 1) White, 2) Hispanic and 3) Black. The dependent variable is income (inc), and years of education (educ) is used as a covariate. Given is the following output from a GLM.

Tips:

- In ANCOVA, the number of degrees of freedom for a covariate equals 1.

- In an ANCOVA with an interaction between covariate and factor, the number of degrees of freedom for the Error equals n - 2 Ã— g.

- The degrees of freedom for the interaction are equal to the product of the degrees of freedom of Covariate and Factor.

- For a true ANCOVA, the number of degrees of freedom for the Error is equal to n - g - 1.

The variance of the dependent variable inc falls in the interval:
