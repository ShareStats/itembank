Question
========
Feyenoord and Ajax fans often criticize each other's teams. We will be looking at what team a person is a fan of [Fan, where Feyenoord = 0 and Ajax = 1], in what city a person lives [City, where Rotterdam = 1, Amsterdam = 2, Dordrecht = 3 and Haarlem = 4], the number of games played by the favourite team that they watched over the years (so the amount of games played by Feyenoord watched by a Feyenoord fan) [played_favourite], and to the amount of games played by the other team that someone watched over the years [played_other]. We also registered whose team became division champion in the last 4 years [Champion, where No championship = 0 and Championship = 1].

What is the average number of games that someone watched when the favourite team played for Ajax fans [Fan=1]? Report the obtained value (using 3 decimals).
