Question
========
Below is the distribution of the happiness level of a random sample of 1919 Dutch people (source: European Social Survey, 2014). Respondents were asked the following question: "Overall, how happy would you say you are?" where the response options ranged between "very unhappy" (0) and "very happy" (10). Is this distribution right-skewed or left-skewed distribution? And how does the mean happiness level compare to the mode and the median?Â
