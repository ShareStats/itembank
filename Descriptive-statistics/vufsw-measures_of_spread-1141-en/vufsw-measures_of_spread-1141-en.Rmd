Question
========
A researcher asks 10 people if they did not eat (0) or they did eat (1)
vegetarian the previous day. This yields the data below.  
  

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Observation</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><em> x </em></td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

  
The standard error of the proportion of people who eat vegetarian is ...

Answerlist
----------
* 0.021
* 0.145
* 0.153
* 0.458

Solution
========





The standard error calculation is; se = sd / (√n)  
  
First calculate the sd: the root from difference between value and the
mean, all sum than divide by the n and from that number again the
root.  
(7x(0,3)<sup>2</sup> + 3X (0,7)<sup>2</sup>)=  2.107  
  
SD = √ (2.107/10)= 0.459  
SE= 0.459 / √10 = 0.145


Answerlist
----------
* False
* True
* False
* False
