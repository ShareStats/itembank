Question
========
A researcher wants to recode the 7-point scale for statement 2 (variable: statement2) to a 5-point scale: the response options 1 and 2 are combined into category 2 and the answer options 6 and 7 are combined to form category 6. The other options remain the same, i.e., 3 = 3, 4 = 4 and 5 = 5. Calculate the mean course exam grade for course 1.3 (variable: course1_3) for students in the new category 6 of statement 2. Write your answer in the answer box (with 5 decimal places).
