Question
========
The average income of a large sample of students who all work at a law
firm is 500 euros (per month), with a standard deviation of 100 euros.
The average income is normally distributed. What is the proportion of
students with an income higher than 450 euros per month?

Answerlist
----------
* 0.50
* 0.56
* 0.69
* 0.31
* 0.85

Solution
========





z = (450-500)/100 = 0.500 (it is half a sd from the mean). The Z Score
Table shows for z = 0.50 the figure of 0.3085. This is the probability
of an income below 450. Thus, the probability of an income higher than
450 euros per month is 1-0.3085= 0.6915.
