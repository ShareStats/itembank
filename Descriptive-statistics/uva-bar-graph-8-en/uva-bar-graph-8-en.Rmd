Answerlist
----------

* It is likely that there is an association because the conditional proportions of 'blonde' are different for 'wearing glasses' than for 'not wearing glasses'.
* There is no reason to think there is an association because the conditional proportions of 'blonde' are the same for 'wearing glasses' as for 'not wearing glasses'.
* Whether there might be an association between 'blonde' and 'wearing glasses' cannot be inferred from these conditional proportions.
