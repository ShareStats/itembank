Solution

The empirical rule is a statistical rule which states that for a normal
distribution, almost all data will fall within three standard deviations
of the mean. Broken down, the empirical rule shows that 68% will fall
within the first standard deviation, 95% within the first two standard
deviations, and 99.7% will fall within the first three standard
deviations of the distribution's average.
