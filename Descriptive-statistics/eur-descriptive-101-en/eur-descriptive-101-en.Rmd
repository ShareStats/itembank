Question
========
Below you find the scores of six students on the course 1.1 exam (social psychology) and the course 1.3 exam (statistics). 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
Students <- 1:6
Exam_Course_1.1 <- c(7.5, 6.2, 5.2, 8.2, 9.2, 6.9)
Exam_Course_1.3 <- c(6.8, 5.4, 7.6, 7.6, 8.4, 4.7)

table <- cbind(Students, Exam_Course_1.1, Exam_Course_1.3)
kable(table)
```

Calculate mean of the exam scores for course 1.1 (2 decimals)


Solution
========
* Mean Exam 1.1 = $\frac{43.20}{6} = 7.20$ (the mean is calculated by summing the scores on the exam and dividing this sum by the number of participants)
