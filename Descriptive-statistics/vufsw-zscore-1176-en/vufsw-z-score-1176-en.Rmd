Question
========
Suppose that the current American president claims that the American
population gives the current US president an average approval score of 7
(on a scale of 1 to 10).  
  
A researcher has doubts about this claim and conducts a random survey
among 121 American respondents. This sample shows that the average
approval score is 6.5 (st.dev. = 1.8).  
  
If we assume that the claim of the president is correct (i.e. that the
average approval score in the population is 7), what is then then
probability that we would find this sample statistic (this sample mean
of 6.5)*?*  
  
​The probability* *is* ...*

* 0.87%
* 2.05%

Solution
========





We first need to calculate the standard error: se = 0.1636.  
Subsequently, we need to calculate the z-score for our sample statistic:
z = (6.5 - 7) / 0.1636 = -3.06  
  
We can then find the P-value for this z-score (see Table A). The P-value
of z-score -3.06 = **0.0011 **  
  
Expressed in percentage: 0.0011 \* 100% = 0.11%
