Question
========
On the first question in the exam of course 2.8, 189 students gave a correct answer and 71 students gave an incorrect answer. 
Suppose we create a variable based on the scores for this exam question, where 0 = incorrect answer and 1 = correct answer.

What is the standard deviation of this variable?


Solution
========
The standard deviation of this variable is $\sqrt{p \times (1 - p)}$, where $p$ is the proportion correct: $\frac{189}{189+71}= .73$. Thus, the standard deviation is $\sqrt{.73 \times (1 - .73)} = .45$ (taking the square root of the variance).
