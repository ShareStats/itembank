It is 3: from 39 - 42  
The **interquartile range** is a measure of where the middle
fifty[](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/middle-fifty/)
is in a data set. Where a
range[ ](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/range-statistics/)is
a measure of where the beginning and end are in a set, **an
interquartile range is a measure of where the bulk of the values
lie.**That’s why it’s preferred over many other measures of
spread[](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/measures-of-spread/)
(i.e. the average of
median)[](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/average/)[](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/median-formula/)
when reporting things like school performance or SAT scores. The
interquartile range formula is the first quartile subtracted from the
third quartile:  
  
**IQR = Q<sub>3</sub> – Q<sub>1</sub>.**
