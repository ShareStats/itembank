Question
========
Why is the **standard deviation** (the *standard deviation*) often preferred preferred over the **range** (the *range*) as a measure of variability?

Answerlist
----------
* He range (the *range*) does not look at the ends of the distribution, but the standard deviation does.
* The range (the *range*) only looks at the ends of the distribution, and the standard deviation is based on all observations.
* The range (the *range*) looks only at the middle of the distribution, and the standard deviation looks at the entire distribution.
* The range (the *range*) expresses variability in a non-standardized way, while the standard deviation is based on z-scores.
