Question
========
Reported is F(2, 20) = 5.80. What do we know about the exceedance probability (p-value) of this test? The excess probability is...

Answerlist
----------
* More than 10%
* Between 5 and 10%
* Between 1 and 5%
* Less than 1%


Solution
========
The critical F value at $\alpha$ = 0.01 is equal to 5.85. The critical F value at $\alpha$ = 0.05 is equal to 3.49. Thus, the p-value will be between 0.01 and 0.05.
