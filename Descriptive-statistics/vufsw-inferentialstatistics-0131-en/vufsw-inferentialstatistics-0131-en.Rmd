Question
========
VU medical school is conducting a study on the effectiveness of a drug that should lead to lower blood pressure. For this purpose, the blood pressure *before* the use of the drug is compared with the blood pressure *after* the drug has been used for three weeks by the subjects studied. The one-sided hypothesis was tested with a significance level of 5% (Î±
= .05).  
  
Another researcher replicated (repeated) this study, with a new sample of 52 subjects. He comes to a different conclusion about the drug's effectiveness than the previous study.  
  
How can we explain such a contradictory result?

Answerlist
----------
* The second researcher uses a different significance level.
* The second researcher chooses a different critical t-value.
* The second researcher observes different difference scores in their sample.
* The second researcher uses a larger sample (N=52).
* All of the above answers provide a possible explanation for such a contradictory outcome.
