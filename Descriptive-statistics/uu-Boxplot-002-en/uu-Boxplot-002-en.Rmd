The boxplots above show the distribution of the height of 113 men and 259 women. Which statement is justified for this boxplot?

Answerlist

* The distribution of the length of men is left skewed (negatively skewed) and the distribution of women is right skewed (positively skewed).
* The distribution of males shows a wider spread in length than the distribution of females.
* The range (range) of scores is greater for males than for females.
* When length in cm is converted to z-scores then the distributions of males and females will both approximate the shape of a normal distribution.
