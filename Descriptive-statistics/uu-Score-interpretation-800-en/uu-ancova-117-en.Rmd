Question
========
A researcher is interested in differences in the heart rates of people in fearful situations. For this purpose, he distinguishes two groups: people with a phobia and people without a phobia. The researcher wants to perform a covariance analysis controlling for heart rate at rest (heart rate_rest). Beforehand, he checks whether or not the assumption of homogeneous regression has been violated. The SPSS output of this analysis is shown below.

Is the assumption of homogeneous regression ($\alpha$ = .05 = 10%) and can the researcher continue to perform an ANCOVA?

Answerlist
----------
* The assumption is met, because p < .10, so an ANCOVA cannot be performed.
* The assumption is met, because p = .22, so an ANCOVA can be performed.
* The assumption is violated, because p < .10, so an ANCOVA can be performed.
* The assumption is violated, because p = .22, so an ANCOVA cannot be performed.
