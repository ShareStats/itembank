Question
========
In the partial correlation matrix below, including zero-order correlations, we examined whether there is a relationship between age and a catwalk model's salary and whether this relationship changes when holding the influence of model attractiveness constant. There holds Y = salary (Salary: in British pounds), X = age (Age: in years), and the third variable (Z) is attractiveness (Beauty: a scale where a higher score means higher attractiveness).

If you round the correlations to two decimal places, which causal model is then apply to the results of the analysis?
