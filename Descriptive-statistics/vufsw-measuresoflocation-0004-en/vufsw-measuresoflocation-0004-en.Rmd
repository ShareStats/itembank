Question
========
A trip leader asks the age (in years) of the nine participants of a group trip (see table below).  
He calculates three center measures (mode, median, and mean age).  
  
However, it turns out then the age of participant 9 is entered incorrectly: That should be "29," instead of "99." Which center measure or center measures will change because of this change?
