Question
========

Suppose that in a population a stochastic variable d is normally distributed with mean 20 and standard deviation 16. We draw from this population a sample of size n = 4. Then the sample mean

Answerlist
----------

* Mean ~ N(μ = 5 , σ = 4)
* Mean ~ N(μ = 20 , σ = 4)
* Mean ~ N(μ = 20 , σ = 8)
* Mean ~ N(μ = 20 , σ = 16)
