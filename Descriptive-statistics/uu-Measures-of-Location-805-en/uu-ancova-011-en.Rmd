Question
========
It is known from previous research that women graduate faster (i.e. in a shorter time) than men. At the request of Minister Plasterk, a researcher is now investigating whether this is also true for PhDs. He has a sample of 200 PhD students from all over the Netherlands. It is also known that the number of hours a person spends with family and friends has a slightly negative effect on the speed of graduation. Therefore, the researcher wants to include "the number of hours of social contacts per week" as a control variable in his analysis. Which of the following alternatives is the most appropriate analysis technique in this situation?

Answerlist
----------
* ANOVA
* ANCOVA
* Repeat measurements analysis
* MANCOVA
