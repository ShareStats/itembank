Question
========
Some whatsapp users can no longer leave their whatsapp alone leave it alone; with them it has become compulsive (compulsive) behavior. This is possibly related to the feeling not to miss anything, or the 'fear-of-missing-out' (FOMO). The database of Esam, Groot, Smits and Verhelst (2016) was collected to investigate this relationship. The data were collected via an online survey of 204 respondents.  
  
In the partial correlation matrix below, including zero-order correlations, we examined whether there is a relationship between compulsive Whatsapp use and "fear-of-missing-out" and whether this relationship changes when holding the influence of education level constant. There is Y = COMPULSIVE (a higher score means more compulsive Whatsapp use), X = FOMO (a higher score means a stronger sense of 'fear-of-missing-out'), and the third variable is EDUCATION (level of education: a higher score means a higher level of education).

How should we substantively interpret the correlation between FOMO and Whatsapp use? interpret?  
   
1: The higher the fear-of-missing-out, the more compulsive the Whatsapp use 2: The lower the 'fear-of-missing-out', the less compulsive the Whatsapp use
