Question
========
A recently-graduated economist gets two job offers.  
  
He can get a job in the US with a monthly salary of $5.000. The mean
salary in the US equals $3.300 and the standard deviation is $800. He
can also get a job in Germany with a monthly salary of €4.000. In
Germany, the mean salary amounts to €2.800 and the standard deviation to
€500.  
  
In which country can he get the highest salary (compared to the mean
salary in the country)? And how can you conclude this?
