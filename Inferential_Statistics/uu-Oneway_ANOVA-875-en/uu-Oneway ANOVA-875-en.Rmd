A teacher investigates the effect of three different teaching methods. Each group of students is taught according to one of the three methods for one week. The educator wants to test the following hypotheses related to the variable "learning outcome. I. $\mu_{1}$ > $\mu_{2}$ > $\mu_{3}$
II. $\sigma_{1}$ = $\sigma_{2}$ = $\sigma_{3}$
Which of these hypotheses can be tested with analysis of variance (ANOVA)?

Answerlist
----------
* I only.
* Only II.
* Both I and II.
* Neither I nor II.

Only the hypothesis $\mu_{1}$ = $\mu_{2}$ = $\mu_{3}$ is testable with analysis of variance - no other hypotheses regarding averages with the signs > or < or regarding variances or standard deviations.
