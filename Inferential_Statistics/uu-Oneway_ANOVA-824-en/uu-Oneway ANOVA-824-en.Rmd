Question
========

The Cognitive Failure Questionnaire uses 25 questions to measure the subjective evaluation of one's own cognitive abilities: it is concerned with the extent to which people have recently suffered from daily mistakes. Mean scores (averaged over the 25 questions) are calculated for three groups of elderly people: elderly people living independently at home without a partner, elderly people living independently at home with a partner, and elderly people living in assisted living facilities. To see if there are differences between these three groups of elderly, SPSS was used.

The p-value of the test was less than 5%. A Tukey's post hoc test was chosen. Part of the SPSS output is shown below.
