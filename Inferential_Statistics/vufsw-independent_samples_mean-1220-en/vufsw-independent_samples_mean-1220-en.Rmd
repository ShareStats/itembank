Question
========
A researcher wants to investigate whether a new medicine against hair
loss is effective. Therefore, she randomly divides a group of men into
two groups. One group receives the new medicine, while the other group
receives a placebo. Hair loss is measured by an ingenious count of the
number of lost hairs per day. What statistical test or technique is best
suited to test the difference in hair loss between the two groups?

Answerlist
----------
* A regression analysis, with medicine use predicting the number of hairs
  lost per day.
* A t-test for independent samples, to test the effect of medicine use on
  hair loss.
* A t-test for paired (dependent) samples, to test the effect of medicine
  use on hair loss.
* A chi square test, to test the association between medicine use and hair
  loss.
