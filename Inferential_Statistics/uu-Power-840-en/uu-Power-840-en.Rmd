Question
========
  
A toy manufacturer asks a developmental psychologist to test children's reactions to a new product (toy). The test used gives the children's reactions scores between 0 and 10. The hypotheses he wants to test are H0: $\mu$ = 5 vs. H1: $\mu$ > 5. The psychologist calculates the power of test 1. Test 1 uses a sample of 50 children. He chooses a significance level of $\alpha$ = 0.05 and an increase of 2 points is expected. If he is going to calculate the power for test 2, using a sample of 100 children with $\alpha$ = 0.01, what happens to the power?
