Question
========
A student working on his MSc thesis uses an experimental design to test
if people that watched a negative piece of news give a lower evaluation
of the image of a specific company than people that watched a neutral
piece of news. The evaluation is measured on a scale of 1 (extremely
negative) to 5 (extremely positive).  
  
The data give the following results:  

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Experimental group (group 1)</strong></td>
<td><strong>Control group (group 2)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>n = 60</td>
<td>n = 60</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Mean = 3.40</td>
<td>Mean = 3.60</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>SD = 0.60</td>
<td>SD = 0.60</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

  
Transform the data given above into a regression equation. The dependent
variable (Y) is the evaluation of the image (EVALUATION) and the
dependent variable (X) is the group (GROUP), where the control group is
the reference category (control group = 0, experimental group = 1).

Answerlist
----------
* EVALUATION= 3.20 + 0.40 \* GROUP
* EVALUATION= 3.60 – 0.20 \* GROUP
* EVALUATION = 0.20 + 3.40 \* GROUP
* EVALUATION = 3.40 – 3.60 \* GROUP
* EVALUATION = 3.40 – 0.20 \* GROUP
* EVALUATION = 3.60 + 3.40 \* GROUP
