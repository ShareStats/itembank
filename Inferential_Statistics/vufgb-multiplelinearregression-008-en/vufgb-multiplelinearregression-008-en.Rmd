Answerlist
----------
* Multiple causes

* Chain relation


Solution
========

The strength of the relationship between depression in a mother and problematic behaviour in the child does not disappear when there is a statistical control for self-control of the mother. In contrast, the relationship weakens as the mothers have higher self-control. In other words, the strength of the relationship depends on how the mother scores on self-control.
