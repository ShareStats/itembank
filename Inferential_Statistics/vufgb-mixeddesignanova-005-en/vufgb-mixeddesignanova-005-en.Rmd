Question
========
Two linear mixed models are used:

* A model with fixed linear effect of time (4 parameters);
* And a model with random linear effect of time (5 parameters). 

![](vufgb-mixeddesignanova-005-nl.png)

Perform a *likelihood-ratio test* to test whether there is a random effect of Time.

Answerlist
----------
* $χ^2 (df = 1) = 22.22$; $p < .001$.
* $χ^2 (df = 5) = $22.22; $p < .001$.
* $χ^2 (df = 1) = $24.22; $p < .001$.
* $χ^2 (df = 5) = $24.22; $p < .001$.
