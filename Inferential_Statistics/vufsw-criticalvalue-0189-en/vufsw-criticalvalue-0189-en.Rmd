Question
========
A survey among a representative sample of 2141 Dutch people (n=2141) by I&O Research into the support for the corona policy shows that 45% of respondents want the measures to be be relaxed (see news item on this below).  
  
Suppose a political commentator claims that he thinks that more than half (50%) of the Dutch want the measures to be relaxed be relaxed.  
  
Test this hypothesis of the commentator using the above sample data. Apply a significance level of 1% (Î± = 0.01). Which **critical** test-statistic should we use in this test?
