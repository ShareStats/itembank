Question
========
  
The following regression equation for predicting $y =$ stress level is given:

$\hat{y} =$ 200 - (Minutes Massage per Day) - 2(Minutes Exercise per Day) + 22(Gender) - 0.5(Gender*Minutes Massage per Day)

Where the Gender variable is coded as Male = 0 and Female = 1.

What is the predicted stress level score for a female who gets massages 30 minutes a day and exercises one hour per day?
