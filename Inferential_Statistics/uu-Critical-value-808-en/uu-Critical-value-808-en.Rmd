Question
========
  
A researcher wants to compare the political orientation of first-year and fourth-year students. A sample of 10 freshmen and 10 fourth-year students are administered a questionnaire on which a score can be obtained from 0 (very progressive) to 100 (very conservative). Freshmen score an average of 62 with a squared SS = 4800, and fourth-year students score an average of 41 with a squared SS = 4200. Based on a two-sided test with $\alpha$ = 5% conclude that the political orientation of first- and fourth-year students is significantly different?
