Answerlist
----------
* 5% is the probability that $H_0$ is rejected while correct (probability of a Type I error).
* 20% is the probability that $H_0$ is not rejected when it should have been rejected (probability of a Type II error).
* 80% is the probability of finding an effect in the sample when it is actually present in the population. Thus, this is the probability $H_0$ is rejected while it is also incorrect (and thus rightly rejected).
* 95% is the probability that $H_0$ is not rejected when it is actually true.
