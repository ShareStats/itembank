Question
========
A politician claims that the average sick leave among older workers is 10 days per year. A researcher doubts this and suspects that the average number of days older workers are absent due to sickness absence is actually lower. He decides to conduct a survey among a random sample of 100 workers in the Netherlands (n=100) and finds in his sample an average sick leave of 9.2 days. The standard deviation is 3.6 days.  
  
What is the probability of such a sample outcome (or an even more worse sample outcome) if we assume that the politician's claim is politician is correct?
