Question
========
The analyses below were carried out on data from a sample of young
adults aged between 20 and 40 years who were interviewed via a
questionnaire about their cultural preferences. The research questions
are:  
  
1: to what extent the preference for cultural holidays (variable: CULVAC
(scale 0-1): a higher score means a stronger preference for cultural
holidays) is caused by the social position of the parental environment
(measured is the education of the parents (variable: FAMEDUC (scale
0-7), ranging from primary education (0) to university (7), a higher
score means a higher education) and  
  
2: whether this relationship can be explained by the own achieved level
of education (variable: EDUC (scale 0-6), ranging from lower vocational
education (0) to university (6), a higher score means a higher
education).  
  
Below are the results of two regression analyses.

What is the indirect effect (mediation effect) of 'FAMEDUC' through
'EDUC' on 'CULVAC'?Â   
*Just give a number in three decimal places, nothing else*
