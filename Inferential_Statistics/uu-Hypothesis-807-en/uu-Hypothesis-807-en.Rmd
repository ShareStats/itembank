A researcher wants to investigate if UCU students differ from Dutch university students in general with regard to the level of academic stress they experience (measured on a scale from 0 to 100). The researcher knows that the average stress score among students in the Netherlands is 59. For her study, the researcher has collected data from a random sample of 36 UCU students. The mean of the academic stress score in the sample was 62 and the estimated population variance (S2) was 100.


What are the research hypothesis (HR) and the null hypothesis (H0) of this study?
