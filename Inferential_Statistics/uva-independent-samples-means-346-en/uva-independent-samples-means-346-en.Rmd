Question
========

Two independent samples were drawn and the following was calculated from them:_____. Sample 1: n = 7, mean = 34, variance = 36. Sample 2: n = 5, mean = 25, variance = 46. The T test for testing H~0~: μ~1~ = μ~2~ has a value of 2.430 here. Which critical value and conclusion regarding TRUE are correct here (α = 10% two-sided)?
