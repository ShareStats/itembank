Lina is curious about the association between extraversion, neuroticism and happiness. All variables are measured by sum scores on validated questionnaires. Based on the estimated regression equation she plots a figure with three regression lines for the association between extraversion and happiness for three different scores of neuroticism. She notices that the three lines differ from each other in both intercept and slope. Which regression equation belongs to this figure?
