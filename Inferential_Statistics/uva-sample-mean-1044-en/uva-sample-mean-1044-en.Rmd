Two balanced dice are rolled. Define the stochastic variable *X* is the sum of the eyes that come up, so we have the following probability with different values of *X*:

  -------- ------ --- ---- --- ------ --- --- --- ---- ---- ------ *X* 2 3 43 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Odds 1/36 ?   ?    ?   5/36 ?   ?   ?   ?    ?    1/36 -------- ------ --- ---- --- ------ --- --- --- ---- ---- ------

Then what is the probability of *X* = 4?
