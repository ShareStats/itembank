Question
========

An ordinal logistic regression is used to examine the relationship between size of debt (*X*, in thousands of euros) and the extent to which families are open to help from agencies (*Y*, 0='is not open to it', 1='is somewhat open to it', 2='is strongly open to it'). An odds ratio of 0.85 is found, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.65-1.05.
