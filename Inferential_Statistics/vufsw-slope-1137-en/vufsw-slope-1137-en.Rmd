Question
========
A teacher is interested in the association (the relationship) between
the number of hours that his students have studied (x) and their
examination marks (y). He performs a regression analysis with these two
variables. The slope of the regression line can be interpreted as ...

Answerlist
----------
* The grade that a student receives when he or she has studied for one
  hour.
* The average grade of all students in this sample.
* The average increase / decrease of the grade if a student studies one
  extra hour.
* None of the above

Solution
========





it is only the slope, without the intercept. Therefore it is not true.
If it was true it was the slope plus the intercept. The right answer is:
the average increase / decrease of the grade if a student studies
one **extra** hour.
