Question
========
On the basis of the output below, Field and Lawson (2003) reported the
effects of giving the same children aged 7–9 years positive, negative or
no information about novel animals. This variable was called 'Infotype'
(levels of Infotype were entered in the following order: positive
information, negative information, no information). The gender of the
child was also examined. The outcome was the centred time taken for the
children to put their hand in a box in which they believed either the
positive, negative or no information animal was housed. The assumption
of Sphericity is not violated.

Contrast analysis was performed on these data (levels of Infotype were
entered in the following order: positive information, negative
information, no information). Using the SPSS output given above,
calculate the effect size (*r*) of the interaction between the contrast
between positive information and no information and gender. Round your
answer to **four **decimal places.


Solution
========





You use the formula for the r of the contrasten

F(1,41)=0.930 and df<sub>R</sub>=41. The outcome is 0.1489.
