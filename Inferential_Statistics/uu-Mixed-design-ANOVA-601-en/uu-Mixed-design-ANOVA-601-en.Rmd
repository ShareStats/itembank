Question
========
The idea is that exam training not only increases the likelihood of passing a test, but also increases pleasure in methods and techniques of research. The SPSS output below shows the results of an experiment on the effect of exam training (TRAINING with 0 = no training, 1 = training) on a test for enjoyment of methods and techniques (PLEASURE with a rating of 1 to 10). This test was administered to the two groups three times (subject within factor TIME): (1) Before exam training; (2) Immediately after exam training; and (3) Six months after exam training.
