Question
========

Two researchers perform a chi-square test for independence on a dataset for a 2-by-2 table. They obtain a P-value that is is less than 0.05. The researchers use a significance level of 0.05 and so they reject the null hypothesis. A disagreement now arises about the conclusion. The first researcher claims that with this result the conclusion must be that the two variables are independent, while the second researcher claims that the variables are actually dependent.
