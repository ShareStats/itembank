Question
========
  
To test whether the CITO test score is a significant predictor of the average grade at the end of the bridge class, we can test the following hypotheses: H0: $\beta$ = 0 H1: $\beta$ â‰  0 What is the result of this key at $\alpha$ = .05?

  
Answerlist
----------
* CITO test score is a significant predictor, because the test quantity is greater than the critical value.
* CITO test score is not a significant predictor, because the test magnitude is smaller than the critical value.
* CITO test score is not a significant predictor, because the p-value is smaller than .05.
* To determine whether CITO test score is a significant predictor, we need the entire SPSS output; it cannot be determined from this data.
