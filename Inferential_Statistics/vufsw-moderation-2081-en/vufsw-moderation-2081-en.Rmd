Question
========
In the regression analysis below, attitude toward culture is the dependent variable (att: 1-4, from negative to positive) and the independent variables are age (lft15 = age -15, so 15 = 0) and school level (in dummies : vmbo-b is the reference category). There is in model 2 added an interaction between age and school level.
