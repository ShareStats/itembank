Question
========
The researcher wants to examine whether there is a relationship between age and contact with the police. The data on this is shown in Table 1 (at the bottom the question).  
H<sub>0</sub>: Age category and contact with police are independent.  
H<sub>a</sub>: Age category and contact with police are dependent.  
  
The researcher calculates the Chi-squared statistic. This turns out to be **70.18**.  
  
What is your conclusion regarding the null hypothesis? Test with alpha = .05.  
  
Table 1: The association between age and contact with police. Observed numbers, with standardized residual (*standardized residual*) in parentheses.

Answerlist
----------
* We can reject the null hypothesis **well** because the observed Chi-squared statistic is **smaller** than the critical Chi-squared.
* We can **not** reject the null hypothesis because the observed Chi-squared statistic is **smaller** than the critical Chi-squared.
* We can **not** reject the null hypothesis because the observed Chi-squared statistic is **greater** than the critical Chi-squared.
* We can reject the null hypothesis **well** because the observed Chi-squared statistic is **greater** than the critical Chi-squared.
