Question
========
Researchers want to know whether men and women differ in their appreciation of a particular advertising campaign (measured on a scale of 0-10). In addition, the researchers are also interested in the effect of educational level (measured with: mbo or lower, hbo, wo), which is also included in the analysis. 

Which analysis technique is most suitable for this research?

Answerlist
----------
* One-way ANOVA
* One-way ANCOVA
* Two-way ANOVA
* Two-way ANCOVA


Solution
========
Dependent variable: appreciation of a particular advertising campaign (interval level of measurement)

First independent variable: sex (difference between men and women; measurement level: nominal)

Second independent variable: educational level (measurement level: nominal/ordinal)

Both independent variables are categorical, so the most suitable technique here is a Two-way ANOVA.
