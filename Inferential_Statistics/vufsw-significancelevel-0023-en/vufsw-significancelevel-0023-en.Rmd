Question
========
A researcher conducts a single regression analysis with "**Income**" (net monthly salary, in euros) as the dependent variable and variable "**Age**" (age in years) as the independent variable.  
  
It calculates a 95% confidence interval (*confidence interval*) of the slope. This interval turns out to be [-0.02; 0.06].  
  
What can we conclude from this, if we test two-sidedly whether Age has a significant influence on Income? We use here a significance level of 5% (Î± = 0.05).

Answerlist
----------
* Age does **have** a significant influence on Income, because the interval does **well** contain the number 0.05.
* Age has **no** significant influence on Income, because the interval contains **well** the number 0.05.
* Age has **no** significant influence on Income, because the interval contains **well** the number 0.
* Age does **well** significantly affect Income, because the interval does **well** contain the number 0.
