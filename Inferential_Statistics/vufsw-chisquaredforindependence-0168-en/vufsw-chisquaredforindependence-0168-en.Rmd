Question
========
A student at the VU studied the use of social media among Dutch people.
For her thesis, she collected data on the use of Instagram from 224
people. In the table (at the bottom of the question), the age category
('leeftijdscategorie'; 'jaar'=year) of the respondents is plotted
against whether they have an Instagram account (actual observed numbers)
('Ja'=yes/ 'nee'= no).  
  
Based on the data in this table, what is the expected value ('expected
count') of the number of people aged 80 or over (80+) who have an
Instagram account at independence of the two variables?
