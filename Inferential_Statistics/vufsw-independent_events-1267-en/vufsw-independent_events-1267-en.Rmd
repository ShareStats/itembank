Do people who are running at least 10 kilometres per week have a higher
heart rate at rest than people who cycle at least 10 kilometres per
week? For the survey, the respondents opted for one of both sports. The
resting heart rate of 200 runners and 200 cyclists was recorded after
several months of exercise.  
  
To answer the question, should you use proportions OR averages of a
dependent OR independent sample?
