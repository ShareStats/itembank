Question
========
Do people who are running at least 10 kilometres per week have a higher
heart rate at rest than people who cycle at least 10 kilometres per
week? For the survey, the respondents opted for one of both sports. The
resting heart rate of 200 runners and 200 cyclists was recorded after
several months of exercise.  
  
To answer the question, should you use proportions OR averages of a
dependent OR independent sample?

Answerlist
----------
* Two proportions of independent samples.
* Two proportions of dependent samples.
* Two averages of independent samples.
* Two averages of dependent samples.

Solution
========





Two averages of independent samples. An average of the heart rate of
people running at least 10 kilometers a week and an average of heart
rate of those who cycle at least 10 kilometers per week. The samples are
independent because it are different people.
