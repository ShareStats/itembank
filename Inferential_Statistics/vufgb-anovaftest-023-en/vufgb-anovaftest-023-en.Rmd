A total of 75 managers are participating. Below is the incomplete table with data resulting from an Oneway ANOVA with Type of Organization as Factor and Risk Behavior as dependent variable.

Answerlist
----------
* 0.02
* 0.54
* 13.46
* 19.38

Solution
========

$Df_{1} = g-1 = 3-1 = 2$; $MS_{factor} = \frac{SS}{df_{1}} = \frac{350}{2} = 175$.

$Df_{2} = N-g = 75-3 = 72$; $MS_{residu} = \frac{SS}{df_{2}} = \frac(650}{72} = 9.03$.

$F = \frac{MS_{factor}}{MS_{residu}} = \frac{175}{9.03} = 19.38$.
