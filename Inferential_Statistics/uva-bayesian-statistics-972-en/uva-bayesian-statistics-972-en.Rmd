Question
========

Suppose it is known that a proportion of 0.002 of Dutch women have disease *D*. There is a test to detect this disease. That test is not always reliable: in 0.04 of the cases in which the person has the disease, the test gives the result Ã’no disease = negative result'. 0.96 of them are detected with a positive result. Furthermore: 0.96 of those who do not have the disease get a negative result. Marja is told that she has a positive test result.

Set the events:

* *G* = No disease *D*,
* *P* = The positive test result.

Then what is the probability P(*G* and *P*) that Marja gets a positive test result and she too has no disease?
