Question
========
What is the best description of the difference between practical significance and statistical significance?

Answerlist
----------
* Practical significance is what you use with small samples (sample size is 100 or smaller), statistical significance you use with large samples (n &gt; 100).
* You use practical significance when testing significance based on the t-distribution, statistical significance when testing of significance based on the z-distribution.
* Practical significance is about the strength of an effect, statistical significance is about the certainty with which you can say that the null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>: no effect exists in the population) is not plausible.
* Practical significance is calculated based on the standard deviation, statistical significance is calculated based on the standard error (SE).
