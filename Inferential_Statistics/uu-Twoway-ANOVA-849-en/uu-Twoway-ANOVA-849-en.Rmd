Question
========
A survey of a random sample of students on their willingness to demonstrate was conducted prior to recent student demonstrations. A researcher conducts an analysis of variance for DEMONSTRATION READiness (0 = no readiness through 100 = very high readiness) with the factors SEKSE and TRAINING. The distinguished groups are all approximately equal in size.

Using the average chart shown, evaluate the following two statements.  I. There is a main effect of TRAINING on DEMONSTRATION readiness. II. There is no interaction effect of SEKSExOPLEIDING on DEMONSTRATION READiness.

Answerlist
----------
* I is correct, II is correct.
* I is not correct, II is correct.
* I is not correct, II is not correct.
* I is correct, II is not correct.


Solution
========
Theorem I is not correct We may assume that all groups are about the same size. Then we find mpedagogy = 30, meducation = 25 and mpsychology = 35 (see asterisks in the mean diagram). The average DEMONSTRATION READiness differs between courses. So there is a main effect of TRAINING on DEMONSTRATION READiness.  Theorem II is not correct In the mean diagram, it can be seen that the lines are not parallel. The effect of TRAINING on DEMONSTRATION READiness is different for men than for women. Thus, there is an interaction effect of SEKSEÃ—OPLEIDING on DEMONSTRATION READiness.
