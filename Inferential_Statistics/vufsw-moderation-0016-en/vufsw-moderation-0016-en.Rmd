Answerlist

* To what extent does the direction and strength of the effect of a cause variable X on consequence variable Y depends on the value of variable Z?
* What is the direction and strength of the effect of cause variable X on variable Z, controlled for the effect of Z on consequence variable Y?
* To what extent does the effect of a cause variable X on consequence variable Y through the mediating variable Z?
* To what extent does the value of cause variable X depend on the direction and strength of the effect of variable Z on consequence variable Y?

Solution
========

concerning I: total 181/620=0.29 , thus 29% total yes.  
For France this would be 0.29*160=46.7.  
Thus 56 (counted) is more than expected .  
Thus I is true  Concerning II: for the Netherlands: 0,29\*150=43,5 to be expected if country and cannabis use is independent.  
Thus 36 is less than expected.  
Thus II is not true.
