Question
========
Of 190 randomly selected secretaries it was recorded how fast they type
(X, in words per minute) and how fast they read (Y, in words per
minute). The regression results are below. What conclusion can we draw
based on the results?  
  
The regression formula is Y= 290.21 + 3.50x  
R-squared = 0.12  
190 - 2 = 188 degrees of freedom

Below are two statements about these results. Which statement(s) is /
are correct?  
  
I. Based on this sample, the typing speed of a secretary has no
significant influence on how quickly she can read (at a significance
level of .05).  
II. A secretary types on average with a speed of 3.50 words per minute.

Answerlist
----------
* Statement I is correct.
* Statement II is correct.
* Both statements are correct.
* None of the statements is correct.

Solution
========





The t value is below the critical value, thus not significant, thus I is
true. And we do not have the information on the average speed, thus II
is false. .
