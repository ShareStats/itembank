Question
========
Which theorem(s) is/are correct about the regression equation Y = b<sub>0</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>X?  
  
I. Y actually represents the predicted value by the regression.  
II. b<sub>0 </sub>is the mean value of Y when X equals 0

Answerlist
----------
* Theorem I. is correct and theorem II. is not correct
* Theorem I. is not correct and Theorem II. is correct
* Both statements are correct
* Both statements are not correct

Solution
========

Theorem I is correct because the regression equation predicts values of Y predicted by means of the regression line a + b<sub>1</sub>X.  
Theorem II is also correct because if you replace X with 0 then the equation Y=b<sub>0</sub>. This means that the pre-measured value of Y (or alternatively, the average Y) is equal to the constant.

Answerlist
----------
* False
* False
* True
* False
