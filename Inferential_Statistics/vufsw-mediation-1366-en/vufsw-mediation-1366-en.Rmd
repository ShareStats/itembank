Question
========
The analyses below were carried out on data from a sample of young
adults aged between 20 and 40 years who were interviewed via a
questionnaire asking about their cultural preferences. The research
questions are (1) to what extent the amount of television viewing
(variable: TVWatching FAMEDUC (scale 0-7), ranging from primary
education (0) to university (7) a higher score means a higher education)
and (2) whether this relationship can be explained by the extent to
which television used to be watched (when the respondent was 12 years
old) by the parents (variable: FAMTV (scale 0-1), a higher score means
that more television was watched).  
Below are the results of two regression analyses.

By what percentage does the effect of 'fameduc' decrease if you compare
model 1 and model 2 in the first regression analysis (use the
unstandradised coefficients)?Â
