Question
========
Which of the following is a test that can be used to assess multivariate
differences in MANOVA?

Answerlist
----------
* Levene's test
* Box's test
* None of the other answers is correct
* Mauchly's test

Solution
========





The correct answer should be Pillai's Trace, Hotelings T<sup>2</sup>,
Wilk's Lamda or Roy's largest root. But none of these exists in the
options.  
  
The Levene's test is used to check the assumption of homogeneity of
variances.  
  
The Box's test is used to check the assumption of equality of covariance
matrices and not the existence of multivariate differences.  
  
Mauchly's test is used to check the assumption of sphericity in Repeated
Measures




Answerlist
----------
* False
* False
* True
* False
