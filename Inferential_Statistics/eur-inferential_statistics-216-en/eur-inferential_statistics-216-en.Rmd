Question
========
In a one-way ANOVA, four experimental groups are compared and simple contrast tests are conducted. Consider the following two statements about these contrast tests:

1. The contrasts are tested with four different t-tests.

2. If the effect size for a contrast, rcontrast, is equal to .09, this is called a moderate effect.

Which statement is true?

Answerlist
----------
* both statements are true
* only statement 1 is true
* only statement 2 is true
* both statements are false


Solution
========
Both statements are false. With four groups and simple contrast, only three comparisons are made. In the case of a simple contrast, each group is compared to the first group (first) or last group (last) depending on what you want to investigate. 

For example, for the simple contrast(first) you get group 1 vs group 2, group 1 vs group 3, and group 1 vs group 4. These are just 3 equations. Statement 2 is also incorrect. Rough guidelines for effect size r are: small is .10, medium is .30, large is .50

Answerlist
----------
* False
* False
* False
* True
