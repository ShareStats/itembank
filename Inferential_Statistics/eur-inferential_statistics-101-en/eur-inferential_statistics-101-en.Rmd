Question
========
A researcher investigates the criterion validity of an instrument that measures test anxiety and that is used to predict the level of experienced stress during an exam. The table below shows the SPSS output of the regression analysis the researcher performed (n=52, 49% woman), where she predicted stress during an exam based on predictors gender and test anxiety. Note that in the variable gender men were coded 0 and women were coded 1.

Write down the regression equation for men and women separately.


Solution
========
The general formulation of the regression line is:
stress = $b_0 + b_1 \times gender + b_2 \times testanxiety$

For men, the equation becomes:
stress = $3.601 + 2.253 \times 0 + .480 \times testanxiety = 3.601 + .480 \times testanxiety$

For women, the equation becomes:
stress = $3.601 + 2.253 \times 1 + .480 \times testanxiety = 5.854 + .480 \times testanxiety$
