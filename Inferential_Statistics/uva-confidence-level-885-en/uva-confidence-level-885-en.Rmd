The mean of group (1) was 30 minutes and standard deviation 5; the mean of group (2) was 60 minutes and standard deviation 6. The researchers assume that the standard deviations in the population are are equal and thus arrive at a *standard error* of 2.017 and 28 degrees of freedom. A 95% confidence interval for the difference 1 - 2 is
