What is the result of this test (at  $\alpha$ = .05)?

Answerlist
----------
* There are significant differences in antisocial behavior between the four groups because $F_{obs}$ > $F_{critical}$.
* There are significant differences in antisocial behavior between the four groups because $F_{obs}$ < $F_{critical}$.
* There are no significant differences in antisocial behavior between the four groups because $F_{obs}$ > $F_{critical}$.
* There are no significant differences in antisocial behavior between the four groups because $F_{obs}$ < $F_{kritiek}$
