Question
========
A management consultant was interested in gauging the success of
different motivation-enhancing practices on employees. She had two
groups of employees who underwent different types of practices: a group
team-building exercise and a confidence-building meeting.  
  
After the motivational practice, participants were asked to endorse
eight statements relating to their motivation (on a five-point Likert
scale from 1 = disagree to 5 = agree): (1) I live for succeeding in my
job,  
(2) I look forward to work when I get up in the morning,  
(3) I do not like missing days through illness,  
(4) I want to work hard to gain a promotion,  
(5) I am going to be more successful this year than last,  
(6) I am in this job to pay the bills,  
(7) People who work harder than me irritate me,  
(8) I often look on the internet for other jobs.  
  
To ascertain whether the motivational practices had an effect on the
responses, the management consultant had to employ a MANOVA
with** \[--I--\]** dependent variables and a factor with** \[--II--\]**
categories. Give always a number as a response!

Answerlist
----------
* I. 8  
  II. 2
* I. 2  
  II. 8
* I. 7  
  II. 2
* I. 2  
  II. 7

Solution
========





Participants were asked to endorse eight statements relating to their
motivation. Therefore, there are 8 dependent variables. There are 2
groups of employees: a group team-building exercise and a
confidence-building meeting. Therefore, the factor has 2 categories.
