Question
========
A consumer researcher was interested in what factors influence people's
fear responses to horror films. She measured gender (0 = female, 1 =
male) and how much a person is prone to believe in things that are not
real (fantasy proneness) on a scale from 0 to 4 (0 = not at all
fantasy-prone, 4 = very fantasy-prone). Fear responses were measured on
a scale from 0 (not at all scared) to 15 (the most scared I have ever
felt). How much variance (as a percentage) in fear is shared by gender
and fantasy proneness in the **population**? Give a percentage as a
response without the % symbol (e.g. 10.1). Use only one decimal.

Solution
========





Since you are asked to provide the percentage of explained variance in
the population, the correct answer is the Adjusted R<sup>2</sup> and not
the R<sup>2</sup>.
