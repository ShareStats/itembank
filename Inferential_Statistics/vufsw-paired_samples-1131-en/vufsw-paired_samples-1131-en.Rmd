Question
========
In an experiment, 20 randomly selected subjects receive training to
improve their mathematics skills. Their performance was measured before
the training took place (measurement 1) and afterwards (measurement 2)
on a scale of 1 to 10. A higher number means better performance. The
results can be found below. A researcher wants to check whether the
training increases the score and tests one-sided with alpha = 0.05.  
  

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>N</td>
<td>mean score measurement 1 (before)</td>
<td>mean score measurement 2 (afterwards)</td>
<td>  mean difference     </td>
<td>standard error (se) of the mean score difference</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>20</td>
<td>         5.75</td>
<td>         6.35</td>
<td>       0.60                      </td>
<td>0.24</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

  
Calculate the t-value associated with testing the researcher's
hypothesis.

----------
* 1.01
* 2.44
* 2.50
* 2.82

Solution
========





Dependent t-test  
  
H<sub>0 </sub> mean(2)-mean (1)=0  
  
H<sub>a </sub> mean (2)-mean (1) does not equal 0  
  
t=(mean(2)-mean(1))/se= 0.6/0.24= 2.5
