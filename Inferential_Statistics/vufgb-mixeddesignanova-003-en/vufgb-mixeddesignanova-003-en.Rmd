What is the correct interpretation of the variance estimate "Intercept [subject = PPN]"?

Answerlist
----------
* Parents became more open during the intervention.
* The extent to which parents were already opening up at the start of the intervention varies.

* The extent to which parents open up during the intervention depends on the time of day.
