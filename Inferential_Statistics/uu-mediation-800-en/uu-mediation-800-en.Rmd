Question
========
  
A researcher has read that a correlation has been found between the number of hours a mother works outside the home and her young children's level of rebellious behavior (measured on a 10-point scale). However, the researcher suspects that this relationship is actually caused by the number of minutes children watch television per day. To investigate this, the researcher measures these 3 variables in a sample of 50 children.
