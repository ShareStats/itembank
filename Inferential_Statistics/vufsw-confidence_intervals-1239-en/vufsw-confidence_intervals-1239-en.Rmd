Question
========
Suppose that a two-sided significance test for a population slope in a
regression has a p-value that is lower than 0.05. Then the 95%
confidence interval for the estimated population slope..

Answerlist
----------
* does **not** contain 0.
* contains 0.
* may contain or **not** contain 0 (we are not sure).
* contains theÂ true population slope.

Solution
========





It does not contain 0. since the P-value of the test with H<sub>0</sub>:
b=0 is lower than 5%, then 0 is not in the range of possible values
according to the 95% confidence interval.



Answerlist
----------
* True
* False
* False
* False
