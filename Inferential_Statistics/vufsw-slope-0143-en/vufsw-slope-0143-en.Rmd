Question
========
Below are the results of a multiple regression analysis with the degree of trust in the police (variable: "**Police**") as the dependent variable, measured on a scale ranging from 1 (very little trust) to 10 (very much trust). The three independent variables in the model are:  
  

- **Migration background**: 0 = no; 1 = yes.
- **Age category**: measured by a scale with five categories ranging from score 0 (16 to 19 years) to 4 (65 years or older).
- **Education level**: the highest education a respondent is is currently pursuing or has already completed, measured by a scale with six categories ranging from score 0 (no education at all) to score 5 (Scientific Education).  
      

Age category and education level have ordinal levels of measurement, but will be considered quantitative for convenience.  
  
Suppose we compare two fictional individuals, Mohammed and Nicolás. Both individuals have a migration background, and both individuals belong to the same age group. Mohammed's educational level (WO; score = 5) is one category higher than the educational level of Nicolás (HBO; score = 4).  
  
Which statement about the estimated difference in the level of trust in the police is correct?

Answerlist
----------
* Mohammed has 0.179 more confidence in the police than Nicolás, expressed on a scale of 1 to 10.
* Muhammad has 0.179 more confidence in the police than Nicolás, expressed on a scale of 0 to 1.
* Muhammad has 0.895 (calculated as follows: 0.179 \* 5 = 0.895) more trust in the police than Nicolás, expressed on a scale of 0 to 1.
* Muhammad has 0.895 (calculated as follows: 0.179 \* 5 = 0.895) more trust in the police than Nicolás, expressed on a scale of 1 to 10.
