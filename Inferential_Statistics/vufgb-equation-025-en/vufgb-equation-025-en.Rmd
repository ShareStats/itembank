Question
========

Given is the following approximate regression equation: $\hat{y} = 25+0.8x_{1}-3.5x_{2}+1.2x_{1}x_{2}$.

What does the regression equation look like for $x_{1} = 10$? 
Answerlist
----------
* $\hat{y} = 33+8.5x_{2}$
* $\hat{y} = 45-3.5x_{2}$
* $\hat{y} = 25+20x_{1}-3.5x_{2}$
* $\hat{y} = 25.8-2.3x_{2}$

Solution
========

Enter $x_{1} = 10$ in the regression equation and work out: $\hat{y} = 25+0.8 \times 10-3.5x_{2}+1.2 \times 10 \times x_{2} = 25+8-3.5x_{2}+12 \times x_{2} = 33+8.5 \times x_{2}$.
