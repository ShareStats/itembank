Above is the correlation matrix showing the correlation between the
degree of enjoyment experienced in literature classes earlier in school
and subsequent attitudes toward reading. Via bootstrapping, the 95%
confidence interval is shown running from .230 to .385.  
  
What does this interval mean?

Answerlist
----------
* If we assume that this sample is among the 95% of samples that contain
  the population value, the correlation in the population is between .230
  and .385.
* For 95%, you can be confident that the population value is between .230
  and .385.
* There is a 95% chance that the population value in the interval is
  between .230 and .385.
* With 95% confidence, the population value fluctuates between .230 and
  .385.
