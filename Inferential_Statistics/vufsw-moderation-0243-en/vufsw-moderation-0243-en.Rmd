Question
========
Below is a regression equation of a moderation model. The dependent variable "**PINC**" is personal monthly income (net, in euros). "**MAN**" is a dummy variable (female = 0; male =1); "**FULLTIME**" is a dummy variable indicating whether a person works 32 hours or more (score 1) or less than 32 hours of paid work per week (score 0).  
  
PINC = 1381 + 644\*MAN + 742\*FULLTIME - 128\*FULLTIME.  
  
Suppose we want to test whether the moderation effect (idem: interaction effect) of MAN on the relationship between FULLTIME and PINC is significant. What should we do then?

Answerlist
----------
* We should then check whether the value -128 is significantly different from 0.
* We must then check whether the value 742 is significantly different from 0.
* We must then check whether the difference between the value 742 and the value 644 deviates significantly from 0.
* We must then verify that the difference between the value 742 and the value -128 is significantly different from 0.
* We must then verify that the difference between the value 644 and the value -128 is significantly different from 0.
