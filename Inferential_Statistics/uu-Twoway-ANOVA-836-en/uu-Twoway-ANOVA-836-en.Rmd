Question
========
  
The study by Danielle Mohren of Maastricht University identifies two factors that influence employee job satisfaction. Namely, an employer's demands (high or low) and the employee's own motivation (high-moderate-low). It is expected that employees TRUE of high demands are less satisfied with their work than colleagues TRUE of lower demands. For her study, the researcher used questionnaires for 27,000 employees; more than 12,000 responded. A higher score on the satisfaction measure means the person is more satisfied.


You decide to replicate Mohren's research. The table below shows your results. What effect(s) is/are visible?
