Lina is curious about the relationship between extraversion, neuroticism and levels of happiness. All variables were measured by sum scores on validated questionnaires. Based on the estimated regression equation, she plots a figure with three regression lines for the relationship between extraversion and happiness for three different scores of neuroticism. She notes that the three lines differ from each other in both intercept and slope. Which regression equation belongs to this figure?
