Question
========

There is an idea that everyone has an internal clock that is affected by circumstances. For example, you may experience as a prolonged event, when in reality the event was of short duration. In research on what affects this internal clock then affects, two factors are considered: factor A: emotional/neutral stimuli presented, and factor B: someone else was in the room with the subject/no one else was in the room with the subject. They then measured self-reports about the perceived time of the subjects that an event lasted. Below is a figure of the results in averages for each of the 4 possible combinations of factor A and B. Given this figure and that the interaction effect is significant, what is a good interpretation of the data?

Answerlist
----------

* An emotional stimulus leads to longer reported perceived duration of an event than a neutral stimulus.
* An emotional stimulus leads to longer reported experienced duration of an event than a neutral stimulus when a person is alone; this pattern reverses when a person is not alone.
* An emotional stimulus leads to shorter reported perceived duration of an event than a neutral stimulus when a person is alone; this pattern reverses when a person is not alone.
