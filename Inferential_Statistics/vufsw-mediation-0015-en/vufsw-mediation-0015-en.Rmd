Answerlist
----------
* The indirect effect is the effect of X on Y that proceeds through the mediator (mediating variable).
* The indirect effect is the effect of X on Y controlled for the effect of mediator (mediating variable) on Y.
* The indirect effect is the effect of mediator (mediating variable) on Y, controlled for the effect of X on Y.
* The indirect effect is the summation of the effect of mediator (mediating variable) on Y and of the effect of X on Y.

Solution
========

concerning I: total 181/620=0.29 , thus 29% total yes.  
For France this would be 0.29*160=46.7.  
Thus 56 (counted) is more than expected .  
Thus I is true  Concerning II: for the Netherlands: 0,29\*150=43,5 to be expected if country and cannabis use is independent.  
Thus 36 is less than expected.  
Thus II is not true.
