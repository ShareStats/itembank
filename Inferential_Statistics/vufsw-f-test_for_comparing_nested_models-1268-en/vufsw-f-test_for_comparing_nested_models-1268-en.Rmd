Question
========
Suppose the F-value in a multivariate regression is significant. Which
conclusion(s) can you draw?  
  
I. The effects of all independent variables are significant.  
II. The explained variance of the regression model is in any case higher
than 1.96.

Answerlist
----------
* Statement I is correct.
* Statement II is correct.
* Both statements are correct.
* Neither statement is correct.

Solution
========





Neither statement is correct. If the F is significant the model as a
whole is significant but you can not say anything about the separate
variables. The explained variance can never be more than 100% or 1.0.
The 1.96 is the critical value of the t test.
