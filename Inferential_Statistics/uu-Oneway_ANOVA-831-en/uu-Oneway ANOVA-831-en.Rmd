Question
========
  
Research by DaniÃ«lle Mohren of Maastricht University identifies two factors that influence employee job satisfaction, the demands made by an employer (high or low) and the employee's own motivation (high-moderate-low). It is expected that employees TRUE of high demands are less satisfied with their work than colleagues TRUE of lower demands. For her study, the researcher used questionnaires for 27,000 employees; more than 12,000 people responded. A higher score on the satisfaction measure means the person is more satisfied.

A researcher does Levene's test to see if the condition of equal error variances is met. She finds as a test size F = 1.744 and a p-value of .147. What is the correct conclusion in this situation?

  
Answerlist
----------
* Levene's test shows that the condition of equal dispersion is met.
* Levene's test shows that the condition of equal distribution is not met.
* Levene's test shows that the condition of normality is not met.
* Levene's test shows that the condition of normality is met.
