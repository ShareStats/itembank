Question
========
A researcher asks 160 randomly chosen people what the ideal group size
(in number of persons) is to work as a team on an assignment. The
respondents' response is on average 6.3, with a standard deviation of
2.8. The researcher tests whether this average deviates significantly
from a test average of 8.  
  
Suppose that instead of 160 people, only 80 people would have
participated in the study, and that the average (6.3) and standard
deviation (2.8) would be the same. What does the decrease in the number
of respondents mean for the calculated (observed) t-value?

Answerlist
----------
* The t-value is unchanged.
* The absolute t-value has become smaller.
* The absolute t-value has become higher.
* Data is missing to calculate the t-value

Solution
========





The absolute t-value has become smaller.  
  
t=mean-mean(test)/se and the se=S/ √n  
  
If n becomes smaller than the se becomes higher, thus t becomes
smaller.
