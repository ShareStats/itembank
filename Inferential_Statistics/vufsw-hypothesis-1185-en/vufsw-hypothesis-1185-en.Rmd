Question
========
A politician thinks that in a new referendum on the Brexit, 53% of the
British would vote in favour of remaining in the EU.  
  
A researcher doubts that this assumption is true and thinks that this
percentage is lower. He draws a random sample of respondents (n=202) to
study this. In this sample, 51% of the respondents answer that in a new
referendum on the Brexit, they would vote in favour of remaining in the
EU.  
  
What is the probability to get such a proportion (or more extreme), if
we assume that the assumption of the politician is true?

Answerlist
----------
* 1.71%
* 2.22%
* 5.7%
* 19.78%
* 28.4%

Solution
========





False.  
  
We first need to calculate the z-score for our sample observation.  
  

  
se = sqrt \[ (0,53 \* 0,47) / 202 \] = 0,035  
  
z = (0,51 - 0,53) / 0,035 = -0,57  
  
Subsequently, the P-value for this z-score can be found in Table A.  
  
P = 0,2843
