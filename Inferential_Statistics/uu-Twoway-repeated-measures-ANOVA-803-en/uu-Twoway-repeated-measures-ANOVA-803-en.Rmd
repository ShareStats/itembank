----------
* 2
* 4

Solution

In a repeated measures analysis, all participants participate in all different conditions. A 2 x 2 x 2 design means that there are three factors, each with two different values. For example: factor 1 = A or B, factor 2 = X or Y, and factor 3 = 1 or 2. A total of the following 8 combinations are then possible: AX1 AY1 BX1 BY1 AX2 AY2 BX2 BY2
