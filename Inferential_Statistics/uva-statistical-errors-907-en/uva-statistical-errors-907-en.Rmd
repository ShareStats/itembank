Question
========

Suppose a researcher has four averages for which she wants to calculate multiple comparison Tukey confidence intervals wants to calculate. There are four averages and thus a total of six possible differences between averages and thus six confidence intervals. The researcher also calculates for comparison the ordinary 95% confidence intervals out. Two of these ordinary 95% confidence intervals are (3, 7) and (12, 16). Now what are possibly Tukey 95% confidence intervals that correspond to the above two ordinary confidence intervals?
