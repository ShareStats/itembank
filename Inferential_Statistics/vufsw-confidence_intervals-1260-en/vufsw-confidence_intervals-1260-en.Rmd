Question
========
The effectiveness of a new diet is examined. It is suspected that people
lose weight when they use the diet. For 150 respondents the weight is
measured in a pre-test (before they start the diet) and in a post-test
(two weeks after they have started the diet). A 95% confidence interval
is calculated for the mean difference in weight, Mean
<sub>before\ measurement</sub> - Mean <sub>after\ measurement</sub>.
This interval appears to be (1.6, 2.8). What can we conclude?

Answerlist
----------
* In at least 95% of all possible samples, we will find an average weight
  loss between 1.6 and 2.8.
* In at least 95% of all possible samples, we will find an average
  **increase** in weight between 1.6 and 2.8.
* The values of the interval are **not** in the critical area, so we
  cannot reject the null hypothesis.
* The values of the interval are in the critical area, so we cannot reject
  the null hypothesis.

Solution
========





Based on this sample, we are 95% sure that the diet leads to a
significant decrease in weight. Because the 0 is not in the CI


Answerlist
----------
* True
* False
* False
* False
