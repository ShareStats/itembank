Question
========
Suppose you are an educational researcher interested in the effect of Kanjertraining on the reduction of bullying behavior. To this end, you are conducting an experiment in which Kanjer training is offered in 50 classes at five schools. In addition, you collected data from five control schools with a total of 35 classes. At the control schools, Kanjer training is not offered in any of the classes. The total number of students involved in the study was approximately 1,500. Questionnaires were administered to the students measuring the decrease in bullying behavior on an interval scale.

What analysis technique is most appropriate for assessing the effect of Kanjer training on the decrease in bullying behavior? 
Answerlist
