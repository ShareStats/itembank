Question
========
Finally, Field described an example of a non-scientific study by a
retail chain for an article in Marie Claire magazine, "shopping is
healthy." Women, on average, were said to walk for longer periods of
time and cover more kilometres than men while shopping, which also
burned more calories. Below is the correlation matrix of the
relationships between **distance **(Distance: in kilometres),
**time **spent shopping (Time: in minutes) and **gender **(Sex: 0 =
male; 1 = female) of the (by Field simulated) data.
