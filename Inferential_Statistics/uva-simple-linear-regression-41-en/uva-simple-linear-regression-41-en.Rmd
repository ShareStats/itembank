Question
========

To establish a relationship between the continuous variables *x* and *y*, a regression analysis is performed. Before interpreting the results interpretation, a number of assumptions for testing the regression coefficients are checked. As a first indication, the values of *x* and *y* are plotted on a graph. The graph shows that the assumption of regression is violated which states

Answerlist
----------

* That the population mean of y is linearly related to x.
* That the population standard deviation of y is the same for all values of x.
