Question
========

The regression equation showing the relationship between *y* = post-measurement on the one hand and sex (*z* = 1 for males) and *x* = pre-measurement on the other is $\hat{y} = 3+0.8x-0.6z$. The mean pre-measurement is 11 for the women and 13 for the men; the `overall' mean of the pre-measurement is 12. For the women, determine the `adjusted mean' on the post-measurement.
