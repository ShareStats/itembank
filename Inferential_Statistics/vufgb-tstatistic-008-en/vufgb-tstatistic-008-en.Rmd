Question
========
  
Given is a *t* distribution with 23 degrees of freedom.

At what *t* value do 97.5% of the values lie on the right-hand side? 
Answerlist
----------
* -2.500
* -2.069
* 2.069
* 2.500 

Solution
========

Look in the *t* table at $df = 23$.

A *t* value of 2.069 gives a right-hand overshoot probability of 2.5%. This means that 2.5% of the values lie on the right. For a *t* value of -2.069, there are 2.5% of the values on the left, and therefore 97.5% of the values on the right.

Tip: Draw the *t* distribution and put in the *t* values and corresponding exceedance probabilities of the 4 answer options!
