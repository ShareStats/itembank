Question
========
A 95% confidence interval for the difference between two sample means is
(-0.08, 0.15). Which of the following statements is correct?

Answerlist
----------
* The probability is 0.95 that a significant difference between the
  population means is between -0.08 and 0.15.
* If we would randomly draw such two samples a 100 times, then the
  difference between their means is between -0.08 and 0.15 in 95 of the
  cases.
* The probability is 0.05 that a significant difference between the
  population means is between -0.08 and 0.15.
* We have 5% certainty that the true difference between the population
  means is between -0.08 and 0.15.

Solution
========





If a 95% confidence interval for the difference between two population
means is (-0.08, 0.15), we have 95% certainty that the 'true' difference
between the population means is between -0.08 and 0.15.
