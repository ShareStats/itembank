Question
========

In the population, 2 in 100 people suffer from the disease *F*. Researchers are designing a test that can detect the disease. But this test is not 100% foolproof. The probability of a negative result when the disease is absent is 0.9 and a positive result when present is 0.7. Suppose the events:Ê \
* *A*: someone who has disease *F*,‖
* *B*: the test with a positive result. \ Then what is the probability that the person being tested has the disease *F*, given that there is a positive result?
