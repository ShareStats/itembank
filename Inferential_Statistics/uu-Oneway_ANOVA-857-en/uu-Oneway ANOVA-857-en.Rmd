What is the value of the effect size to be reported in this analysis?

Answerlist
----------
* There are no significant differences between the teaching methods, F(2, 72) = 2.90, p=.062.
* There are significant differences between teaching methods, F(2, 72) = 2.90, p=.031.
* There are significant differences between teaching methods, F(2, 75) = 3.02, p =.031.
* There are no significant differences between the teaching methods, F(2, 75) = 3.02, p=.062.
