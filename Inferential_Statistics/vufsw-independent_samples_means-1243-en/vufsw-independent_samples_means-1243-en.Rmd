Question
========
The Executive Board of the VU wants to know whether the degree of
satisfaction with the study (measured on a scale of 1 to 10) is related
to the gender of the student. For this she bases herself on evaluation
scores of 100 randomly selected female and male students. Which
statistical test is most suitable for testing the hypothesis?

Answerlist
----------
* One sample t-test
* Independent t-test
* Dependent t-test
* Chi-sqare test

Solution
========





It is the independent t test. The **independent t-test**, is an
inferential statistical **test** that determines whether there is a
statistically significant difference between the means in two unrelated
groups.  
  
The **dependent t-test** (also called the **paired t-test**or
**paired**-samples t-**test**) compares the means of two related groups
to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference
between these means.  
  
**The **One Sample t Test** is commonly used to **test **the
following:**  

1.  Statistical difference between a **sample** mean and a known or
    hypothesized value of the mean in the population.
2.  Statistical difference between the **sample** mean and the
    **sample** midpoint of the **test** variable.

 **Use** the **chi**-**square test** for independence to determine
whether there is a significant relationship between two categorical
variables.
