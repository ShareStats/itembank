Question
========
  
In a research report of an experiment with a control group and an experimental group of 15 people each, independent of this, a 95% confidence interval for the mean Î¼ was given for both groups: - for the experimental group: <12; 18> - for the control group: <10; 16> The question, however, is whether the sample mean in the experimental group at $\alpha$ = 5% is significantly higher than that in the control group.

Can this be verified from these data?

  
Answerlist
----------
* Yes, the result is not significant because the interval of the experimental group overlaps that of the control group
* Yes, because the sample averages are 15 and 13 respectively; since this difference is less than 2 interval width, the difference is not significant
* Yes, based on the intervals, the mean and standard deviation of both samples can be calculated, and then the test result can be determined via the t-test procedure.
* No
