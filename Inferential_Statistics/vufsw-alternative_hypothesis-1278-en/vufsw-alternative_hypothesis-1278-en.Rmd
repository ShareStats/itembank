Question
========
Suppose that it is known that 50% of those who are entitled to vote in
the Netherlands are between 35 and 64 years old, while 25% are between
18 and 35 years and 25% are older than 65 years.  
  
During the Provincial elections in the Netherlands in 2019, the party
*Forum voor Democratie*(FvD) came first. A researcher thinks that the
percentage of older voters (65 years or older) that supported the FvD is
larger than 25%. To test this, she uses a random sample with data
collected by the research bureau Ipsos. Actually, the data come from an
online survey of 2,848 people that are entitled to vote in the Dutch
national elections.  
  
These data give the following results:

The researcher uses a significance level of 5% (alpha = 0.05).  
  
What is the alternative hypothesis of this test?
