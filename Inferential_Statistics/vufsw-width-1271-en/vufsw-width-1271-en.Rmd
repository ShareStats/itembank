Question
========
In a survey, 1414 respondents were asked how many hours they spent on
religious activities. The sample mean was 6.15 hours with a standard
deviation of 16.53 hours. Find the 95% confidence interval for the
population mean.

Answerlist
----------
* 5.43; 6.87
* -26.24; 38.55
* 5.29; 7.01
* 5.03; 7.27

Solution
========





You can calculate this with the following formula: CI for mean y
+/-* t(se) *with *se* = *s / √n*  
  
Thus: 6.15 +/- 1.96\* (16.53/ √1414)=(5.29; 7.01)
