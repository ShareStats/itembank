Question
========

Given is the table of correlations for three predictors *x*~1~, *x*~2~ and *x*~3~.

  -------- -------- -------- -------- *x*~1~ *x*~2~ *x*~3~ *x*~1~ - *x*~2~ 0.01 \- *x*~3~ 0.03 0.05 \- -------- -------- -------- --------

The regression equation for the dependent variable *y* with only *x*~1~ and *x*~3~ is $\hat{y} = -12.44 + 4.91x_{1} + 2.01x_{3}$
Now suppose the model is calculated with *x*~2~ added. Then the coefficient
