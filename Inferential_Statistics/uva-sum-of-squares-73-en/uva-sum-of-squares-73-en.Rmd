Question
========

In an ANOVA, the difference in averages can be described in terms of regression. Suppose a one-way ANOVA (one factor) with three groups is converted into a regression with the following coding:

  ------- -------- -------- --------------------- ------------------- group *x*~1~ *x*~2~ averages interpretation *β* 1 1 0 *μ*~1~ = α + *β*~1~ 2 0 1 *μ*~2~ = α + *β*~2~ 3 0 0 *μ*~3~ = α ------- -------- -------- --------------------- -------------------

The interpretation of *β*~3~ is clear, which is α.The interpretation of the other two coefficients is as follows:

Answerlist
----------

* Β1 = μ1 - μ2 and β2 = μ1 - μ3.
* Β1 = μ1 - μ3 and β2 = μ2 - μ3.
* Β1 = μ2 - μ3 and β2 = μ1 - μ3.
