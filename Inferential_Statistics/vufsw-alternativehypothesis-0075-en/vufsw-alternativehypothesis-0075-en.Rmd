Question
========
A survey included the question below on the extent to which to what extent a person trusts the police. This variable is called "Rating_police".  
  
Respondents also answered questions about their origins. According to the CBS definition, a person has a migration background if this person, or one of the parents, was born in another country. On the basis this, the researcher constructed the dummy variable "Migration background" constructed (1=respondent has a migration background; 0=respondent has no migration background).  
  
She expects people with a migration background to have less trust have in the police than people without a migration background and conducts an Independent t-test to find out whether this is so. We test one-way with Î± = 0.05 (alpha =5%). What is the correct alternative hypothesis associated with this one-sided test?
