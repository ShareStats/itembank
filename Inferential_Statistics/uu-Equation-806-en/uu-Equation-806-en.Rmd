Question
========
  
A psychologist attached to a prison is interested in the relationship between crime and intelligence. A crime index (between 0 and 50) is formulated that takes into account the severity and frequency of crimes committed. Intelligence is measured with a standardized IQ test. Eighteen convicted juveniles participate in this study. SPSS was used to describe the relationship between the two variables. Part of the SPSS output is shown below.
