Question
========
  
Single linear regression shows a positive relationship between the stress hormone cortisol ($x_{1}$) and depressive symptoms (*y*). However, when a multiple linear regression statistically controls for negative life events ($x_{2}$), the link between cortisol and depressive symptoms disappears.
