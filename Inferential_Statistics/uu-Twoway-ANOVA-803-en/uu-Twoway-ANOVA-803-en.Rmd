Question
========
  
A study by Wiede et al. (2005) looked at the amount of empathy (empathy) of aggressive children between the ages of 8 and 12, also looking at the difference between boys and girls. Here a distinction is made between aggressive children, aggressive children also diagnosed with ADHD, and children without behavioral problems (control group). Empathy is measured by showing a video of a boy falling off his bicycle, followed by a questionnaire that can be scored on a scale from 0 to 100.

In Utrecht, the study by Wiede et al. is being replicated and the same research design is being used. The replication also looks at the combination of gender and aggression on empathy.

In the replication of the Wiede et al. study, the aim is to test the following hypothesis, Halt:	$\mu$1 > $\mu$2 > $\mu$3 , where: Group 1 = control Group 2 = aggression + ADHD Group 3 = aggression  Can this be tested within the two-way ANOVA?
