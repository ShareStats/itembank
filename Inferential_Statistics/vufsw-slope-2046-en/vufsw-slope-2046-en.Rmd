Question
========
In the output below, a sample of young people aged 14-17 years, the extent to which cultural participation (culpar: continuous scale 1-100: low -&gt; high) depends on age (lft15: in years, 15 years =0) and of mother's cultural participation (pmcul: continuous scale 0-1: low -&gt; high). An interaction term is also included between age and maternal cultural participation (lft|pmcul: calculated as lft15 pmcul).
