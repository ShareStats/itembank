Question
========
We analyse whether the performance of pupils differs between 3 subjects:
literature, essay writing and mathematics (they are in this order in the
data set).  
In addition, we investigate whether any differences between the 3
subjects vary between male and female students.   
Therefore, we use a Mixed Design ANOVA.  
The output of this analysis is shown below. "Female" is coded as 0:
male, 1: female.  
**If **the output below violates the assumption of homogeneity of
variances, what F value indicates this?  
*Round to 3 decimal , record 0 if the assumption is not violated.*
