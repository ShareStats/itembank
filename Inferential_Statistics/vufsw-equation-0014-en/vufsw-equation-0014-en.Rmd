Question
========
Below is the formula of a multiple regression of Y with two independent variables (X<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub>).  
Suppose you want to know whether **X**<sub>**1** </sub>has a significant influence on Y, controlled for the effect of X<sub>2</sub> on Y ("X<sub>2 </sub>is held constant").  
  
So what should you test in this case? You must then, as an investigator test whether ...

Answerlist
----------
* The value of **b**<sub>**1** </sub>significantly differs from 0
* The difference between the value of **b**<sub>**1** </sub>and the value of **b<sub>**2**</sub>** ****significantly differs from 0
* The difference between the value of **X**<sub>**1** </sub>and the value of **b**<sub>**1**</sub> significantly deviates from 0
* The value of **X**<sub>**1**</sub>significantly differs from 0

Solution
========

it is y = a + b<sub>1</sub> x <sub>1 </sub>+ b<sub>2</sub> x <sub>2</sub>

Answerlist
----------
* True
* False
* False
* False
