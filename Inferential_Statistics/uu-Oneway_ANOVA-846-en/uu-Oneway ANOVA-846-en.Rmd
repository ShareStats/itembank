Question
========
A researcher compared the testosterone levels of men in four different sports: soccer, athletics, speed skating and cycling. The total sample size was N = 30 (10 soccer players, 10 athletes, 5 skaters and 5 cyclists). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to compare the results. The square sum that measures the differences between the groups is 60. The square sum that measures the differences within the groups is 100. If we test with $\alpha$ = 0.01, then what is the correct conclusion?

Answerlist
----------
* Analysis of variance shows significant differences, F(3, 26) = 5.2, p < .01, $\eta^2$ = .375.
* Analysis of variance shows significant differences, F(4, 29) = 4.35, p < .01, $\eta^2$ = .375.
* Analysis of variance shows significant differences, F(3, 27) = 5.4, p < .01, $\eta^2$ = .375.
* Analysis of variance shows no significant differences, F(4, 26) = 3.9, p > .01,
$\eta^2$ = .375.
