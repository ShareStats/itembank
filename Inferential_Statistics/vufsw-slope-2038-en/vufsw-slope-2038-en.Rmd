Question
========
We analyze data obtained from high school students in secondary education from the Youth & Culture Data (Ganzeboom & Nagel, 1998-2002). For this database, over 3,000 young people were surveyed in the age from roughly 14 to 17 years of age.    
  
In the regression analysis below, participation in popular culture is is the dependent variable (pjcul: 1-100, from little to a lot of participation) and the independent variables are gender (0= boy, 1 = girl) and maternal cultural participation (pmcul: 0-1, from least to most culturally active). In addition, an interaction added between gender and mothers' cultural participation (female pmcul).
