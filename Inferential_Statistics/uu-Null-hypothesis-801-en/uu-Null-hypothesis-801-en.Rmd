Question

An occupational and organizational psychologist is interested in the relationship between the degree of attachment to the company (interval scale) and the number of days of illness in a year. In a random sample of 30 employees, she finds a correlation of $r = .37$.

What is the null hypothesis when the presence of a correlation is tested?

Answerlist
----------
* $H_0: r = 0$
* $H_0: r > 0$
* $H_0: \rho = 0$

A hypothesis is a statement about the value in the population ($\rho$). A null hypothesis always states that there is no correlation: ($\rho=0$).
