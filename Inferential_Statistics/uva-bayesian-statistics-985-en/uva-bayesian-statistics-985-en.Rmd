Question
========

A company *A* owns three factories, namely *A*~1~, *A*~2~ and *A*~3~ TRUE where razors of the same type are made. The probability of a defective device at *A*~1~, *A*~2~ and *A*~3~ is, respectively: 0.1; 0.06 and 0.05. During a given period, all three factories together must make 10,000 razors of which 2,000 are made by *A*~1~, 5000 by *A*~2~ and 3000 by *A*~3~. From the total production, an inspector randomly selects a shaver, how likely is it that this device is defective (*D*)?
