Reading books is not popular with young people and the question is what
can be done about it? Does it matter if young people enjoyed literature
classes at school? Does that encourage reading behaviour?  

In the above covariance/correlation matrix, the correlation between the
pleasure experienced in literature classes at school (enjoyclasses) and
subsequent reading frequency (yearlyreading) has been omitted. What is
the correlation? *Give a number in three decimal places.*
