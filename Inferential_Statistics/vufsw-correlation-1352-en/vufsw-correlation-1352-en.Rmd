Question
========
Some whatsapp users can no longer leave their whatsapp alone; for them
it has become compulsive behaviour. This is possibly related to the
feeling of not wanting to miss anything, or the 'fear-of-missing-out'
(FOMO). The data file of Esam, Groot, Smits and Verhelst (2016) was
collected to investigate this relationship. The data were collected via
an online survey among 204 respondents.  
  
In the partial correlation matrix below, including zero-order
correlations, we examined whether there is a relationship between
compulsive Whatsapp use and 'fear-of-missing-out' and whether this
relationship changes when holding the influence of educational level
constant. The variables Y = COMPULSIVE (a higher score means more
compulsive whatsapp use), X = FOMO (a higher score means a stronger
feeling of 'fear-of-missing-out'), and the third variable is EDUCATION
(level of education: a higher score means a higher level of
education).

If you round off the correlations to two decimal places, which causal
model applies to the results of the analysis?
