Question
========
Below are the results of a regression analysis of the influence of age ("**AGE**") on income ("**PINC**"), disaggregated by education category (see Figure 1). The dependent variable "**PINC**" is personal income (net, in euros per month).  The independent variable "**AGE**" is a person's age (in years). "**HIGHEDUC**" is a dummy variable (highly educated = 1; less educated =0); highly educated implies that a person has at least 14 years of education, less educated implies that someone has 14 years or less education.  
There seems to be moderation/interaction in this case. How can you infer this from the figure?Â
