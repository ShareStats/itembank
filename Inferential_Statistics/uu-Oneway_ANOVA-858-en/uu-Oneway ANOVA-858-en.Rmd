Question
========
In a study on school enjoyment, a sample of students in grades 3, 4, 7 and 8 from a number of elementary schools were given a questionnaire with eight questions measuring school enjoyment. For all questions, there were four response categories where a high score meant that the student enjoyed going to school.

Analysis of variance was used to determine whether the groups differed in terms of school enjoyment. Tested with $\alpha$ = .05. The SPSS output can be found below.
