Question
========
In subjects, decreases in depression are measured on a continuous scale (Y). One is interested in the effects of three types of therapies: A, B or C, but one also measures background variables $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$. To predict the decrease in depression, two dummy variables are created for therapy:

The regression equation for Y is: $$hat{Y}$ = 6.0 - 1.2$D_{1}$ + 1.4$D_{2}$ + 2$X_{1}$ +3$X_{2}$


When choosing the two dummy variables, one of the therapies became reference category. If dummy variables other than the two chosen in Question 6 are chosen, then...

Answerlist
----------
* Changes a person's estimated decline.
* Changes the constant (the intercept).
* Changes the B values of the X variables.
* More than 1 of the three alternatives (a), (b) and (c) is TRUE.
