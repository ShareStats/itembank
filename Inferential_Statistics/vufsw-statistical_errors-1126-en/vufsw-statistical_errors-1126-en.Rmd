Question
========
Decide whether the following statements are true or false.  
  
I. The probability of making a type I error depends on the level of
significance.  
  
II. We make a type II error if we make the mistake that we do *not*
reject the H0, while H0 is in fact false.

Answerlist
----------
* Statements I and II are true.
* Statement I is true and statement II is false.
* Statement I is not true and statement II is true.
* Statements I and II are false.

Solution
========





They are both true.  
  
I) Wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis, or stating that there is a
statistically significant difference in the data when in fact there is
not (false positive), is called type I error or alpha error. The
probability of type I error depends on the level of significance
assigned by the investigator and the existence or nonexistence of a
difference between the two experimental conditions.  
  
  
A level of significance of 5%, or 1 in 20, is arbitrary set. 5% chance
of making a type I error. If p is probability and p &lt;0.05, there is
5% chance that an observed difference occurred because of chance.  
  
  
II) A type II error is failing to reject a false null hypothesis (also
known as a "false negative" finding)  
  
  
EXTRA: Why not always set a very small alpha value? The consequence of
setting a p-value of .01 versus .05 is that there is an increased risk
of making a type II or beta error. This is a failure to reject the null
hypothesis when it is in fact false. The smaller the p-value, the more
likely one is to make a type II error. The power of a test is 1-beta.
The probability of making a type II error depends on 4 factors. 1) size
of alpha (as discussed) 2) variability within a population (more
variability results in greater likelihood of type II error) 3) sample
size (more subjects results in less chance of type II error) and 4) the
magnitude of difference between the experimental conditions (smaller
differences result in higher likelihood of type II error).
