Question
========
An exact repetition of the above study with an equally large group of new respondents shows that the group averages differ more from each other than in the first study. The spread in scores on the dependent variable within the groups remains the same.

What effect does this result have on the F-test size?

  
Answerlist
----------
* This cannot be inferred from this information.
* The F-key magnitude becomes larger.
* The F-key magnitude becomes smaller.
* The F-strike magnitude remains the same. 


Solution
========
The between-factor has a larger share of the total variance. All other factors remaining equal, the $MS_{between}$ thus greater relative to the $MS_{within}$, thereby also increasing the F-value.
