Question
========
The analysis below deals with the potential harmful effects of cell phones. Field imagines a fictional experiment in which subjects are strapped a cell phone to their head and TRUE in which this phone is turned on for a fixed number of hours each day. After six months, the extent of any damage is measured near the ear (variable: ear damage, amount of ear damage). Six groups distinguished, who 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 hours per day (variable: usage) were exposed to these 'phone microwaves'.
