========
Eight men applying to Cambridge University had a sample mean and variance on College Board tests of 1050 and 2500 respectively. The respective numbers for nine women were 1075 and 3600. Test at the .05 level of significance whether women did better than men on these tests. Use the five steps of hypothesis testing.

Solution
========
  

1. $H_0: \mu_f = \mu_m$ and $H_{A}: \mu_f > \mu_m$
2.  a. $S^2_{male} = 2500$ : $S^2_{female} =3600 $
    b. $S^2_{pooled} = \frac {(8-1)2500 + (9-1)3600}{8+9-2} =3086.7$
    c. $S^2_{m1} = \frac {3086.7}{8}= 385.8375;S^2_{m2} = \frac {3086.7}{9}= 342.9667$
    d. $S^2_{difference}= S^2_{m1} + S^2_{m2} =728.8042$
    e. $S^2_{difference}= \sqrt{728.8042} = 26.99637$
3. $\alpha=.05$, $df_{Total} = 8+9-2=15$, cut-off $=-1.753$
4. $t= \frac {1050-1075}{\sqrt {3086.7 (1/8 + 1/9)} } =  -0.9261 \approx -0.93$ 
5. Do not reject $H_0$. Women's scores were not higher than men's scores.
