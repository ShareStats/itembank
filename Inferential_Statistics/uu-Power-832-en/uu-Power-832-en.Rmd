Question
========
  
A teacher wants to know if the current group of first-year students is performing better than the freshmen in the previous year. He does this by comparing the average exam scores. Last year that average was 6.0. A sample of 61 students is now drawn from the current year. The instructor considers this year "better" only if at least an average exam grade of 6.5 is achieved. The dispersion in the population is unchanged, i.e. σ = 1.7.
