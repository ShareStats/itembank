Question
========
Suppose a researcher wants to test whether the average number of hours
that young people listen to music is higher than 15 hours per week.
Which statistical technique or test is most suitable for testing this?

Answerlist
----------
* One-sample t-test
* Independent t-test
* Chi-squared test
* Single regression

Solution
========





It is a one sample t test.  
The One Sample t Test determines whether the sample mean is
statistically different from a known or hypothesized population mean.  
  
The independent t-test  compares the means of two independent groups in
order to determine whether there is statistical evidence that the
associated population means are significantly different.  
  
The chi-squared test is used to determine whether there is a significant
difference between the expected frequencies and the observed frequencies
in one or more categories.  
  
Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to
summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative)
variables.
