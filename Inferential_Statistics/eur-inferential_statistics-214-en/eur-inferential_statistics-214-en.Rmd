Question
========
In SPSS a hierarchical regression analysis is conducted to predict Y from X1 (block 1) and X2 (block 2). The Venn-diagram below indicates for this analysis what the contribution is of each predictor to the explained variance in Y.

Which part in the Venn-diagram indicates the R2-change for X2 (block 2)?

Answerlist
----------
* 1 + 2 + 3
* 2 + 3
* 2
* 3


Solution
========
The correct answer is 3. R-square change relates to the extra variance you could explain if you included X2 (on top of X1). In the Venn diagram this can be seen as the unique variance in Y explained by X2 (or piece 3).

(1+2+3) is incorrect, as this piece represents the R-squared (explained variance) of the whole model (that is, when you include both X1 and X2 to predict Y). (2+3) is incorrect, this piece would be the R-squared (explained variance) if you only include X2 to predict Y. (2) is incorrect. This represents the variance in Y shared by both X1 and X2 (without the unique contributions of X1 and X2).
