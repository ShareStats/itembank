Question
========
Field claims that there has been an increase in muscle injuries as a as a result of playing Nintendo's Wii computer game. A researcher expects that people who play sports are less affected by this suffer from this because they are already accustomed to exercise. For those non-athletes, she expects that a warm-up prior to a Wii session will help prevent these injuries.  
  
To investigate this, she selects 120 athletes and 120 non-athletes ('athlete' - yes(1)/no(0)). Within each of the two groups, the participants were then randomly assigned to two groups: half had to do a 5-minute stretching (warm-up), and the other half did not (variable 'stretch' - yes(1)/no(0)). In all participants, after after the 4-hour Wii session, pain symptoms were measured on a scale of 1-10 ('injury'; 0 = no pain, 10 = strong pain).  
  
Below are the results of the analysis.
