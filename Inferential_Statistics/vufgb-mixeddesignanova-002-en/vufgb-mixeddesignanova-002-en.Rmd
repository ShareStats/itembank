Question
========
Two linear mixed models for repeated measurements are compared. These are a model with a *fixed effect* for time and a model with a *random effect* for time. The *-2LogLikelihood* for the model with *fixed effect* is 259, and for the model with *random effect* is 262. Perform a *likelihood-ratio* test with the following objective: test whether the *random effect* for time is significant.

Answerlist
----------
* *z* = 3, *p* < .05.
* *z* = 9, *p* < .05.
* $χ^2$(*df* = 1) = 3, *p* > .05.
* $χ^2$(*df* = 1) = 9, *p* < .05.
