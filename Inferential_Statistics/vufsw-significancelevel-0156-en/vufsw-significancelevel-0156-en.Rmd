Question
========
A researcher conducts a multiple regression to determine which factors that influence the extent to which a person watches television (**Y**). The data used comes from the *European Social Survey* from 2014. The questionnaire was administered to a random sample from the population of the Netherlands aged 18 years and older (N=1362). The extent to which a person watches television was measured with a question in which response options ranged from 1 ("less than half an hour per day") to 7 ("more than three hours a day"). Education ("**Educyrs**") was measured in number of years of education completed; scores on this variable range from 0 years to 28 years. The researcher obtains the results below. The researcher examines whether the three independent variables have an impact on Y and conducts a test conducted. He uses a significance level of 5% (Î± = .05).
