Question
========
Below are the results of a stepwise regression analysis. The dependent variable "**PINC**" is personal monthly income (net, in euros). "**AGE**" is a person's age in years; "**HIGHEDUC**" is a dummy variable (highly educated = 1; not highly educated =0); Highly educated implies that a person has completed a college or university level education completed or is currently pursuing such an education. "**AGE_HIGHEDUC**" is a multiplicative interaction term of the variables "**AGE**" and "**HIGHEDUC**".  
  
Study the regression model with the interaction term (Model 3).  
  
Suppose we compare two **highly educated** individuals, Boris and Donald. Boris is **1 year older** than Donald. How much higher is the estimated monthly income of Boris compared to Donald?  
  
And now suppose we compare two **lowly educated** individuals compare, Angela and Mark. Angela is **1 year older** than Mark. How much higher is Angela's estimated monthly income compared with Mark?
