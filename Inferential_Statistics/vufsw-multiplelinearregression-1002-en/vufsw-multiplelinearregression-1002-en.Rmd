Question
========
Recent research has shown that lecturers are among the most stressed
workers. A researcher wanted to know exactly what it was about being a
lecturer that causes this stress and subsequent burnout. She recruited
75 lecturers and administered several questionnaires that measured the
following variables: ** Burnout ** (high score = burnt out),
** Perceived Control ** (high score = low perceived control ), ** Coping
Ability ** (high score = low ability to cope with stress), **Stress from
Teaching** (high score = teaching creates a lot of stress for the
person), **Stress from Research** (high score = research creates a lot
of stress for the person), and **Stress from Providing Pastoral Care**
(high score = providing pastoral care creates a lot of stress for the
person). The outcome of interest was burnout. Cooper’s (1988) model of
stress indicates that perceived control and coping style are important
predictors of this variable. The remaining variables were used as
predictors in the regression to see the unique contribution of different
aspects of a lecturer’s work to their burnout.  
  
Which of the predictor variables has the strongest effect on burnout
according to the output shown below?

Answerlist
----------
* Perceived control because it has the highest unstandardized coefficient
* Coping ability because it has the highest standardized coefficient
* Stress for teacing because it has the highest absolute value of the
  standardized coefficient
* None of the other options is correct

Solution
========





When we want to compare the effect of different variables in the same
regression, we use the standardized coefficient (beta). As shown in the
table of the coefficients, the variable Coping Ability has the highest
beta (0.663).
