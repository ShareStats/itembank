Question
========
We are researching the effect of *hours *of training and *attitude *on
the *performance *of a specific skill (e.g. the number of goals scored).
For this purpose, we run 2 regressions with *performance *as the
dependent variable.  
  
In the first regression, *hours *of training and *attitude *are included
as independent variables, while in the second regression, we also add
the interaction between hours of training and attitude as an independent
variable.  
  
We perform the F-test for the *R<sup>2</sup> change* to decide whether
to choose the second regression instead of the first one.  
  
The following regression equation refers to the second regression. Which
of the following statements on the R<sup>2</sup> change and the F-test
of the R<sup>2</sup> change is plausible?  
  
*p**e**r**f**o**r**m**a**n**c**e* = 1.23<sup>\*</sup> + 0.112 × *a**t**t**i**t**u**d**e* + 0.531<sup>\*</sup> × *h**o**u**r**s* + 0.167<sup>\*</sup> × *a**t**t**i**t**u**d**e* × *h**o**u**r**s*  
  
\* indicates a statistically significant effect

Answerlist
----------
* R<sup>2</sup> change = 0.051, F(1,537)=4.2537, P-value=0.0396
* R<sup>2</sup> change = 0.051, F(1,537)=4.2537, P-value=0.396
* R<sup>2</sup> change = -0.001, F(1,537)=4.2537, P-value=0.0396
* R<sup>2</sup> change = -0.001, F(1,537)=4.2537, P-value=0.396

Solution
========





These numbers indicate an increase in the R<sup>2 </sup>due to the
inclusion of the interaction in the regression and a statistically
significant F-test for the R<sup>2 </sup>change. The interaction effect
between attitude and hours is statistically significant (see the \* that
is placed next to it in the regression equation). In the case of a
single interaction, the F-test of the R<sup>2</sup> change always agrees
with the t-test of the interaction. When a variable is included in the
regression the R<sup>2 </sup>always increases, at least by a tiny bit.
In no whatsoever case can the R<sup>2 </sup>decrease due to the
inclusion of a variable in the regression. Moreover, the interaction
effect between attitude and hours is statistically significant (see the
\* that is placed next to it in the regression equation). In the case of
a single interaction, the F-test of the R<sup>2</sup> change always
agrees with the t-test of the interaction.
