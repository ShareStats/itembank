Question
========
Using data from a randomly drawn sample of fifteen children aged 3 to 5 years, the following regression equation was constructed:
 
$Y = 0.75 + 0.75X$

$X =$ age in years; $Y =$ The number of correctly completed Piaget's experiments on the concept of shape constancy.

The total number of completed trials equals 6.

Furthermore, given is:  $M_X = 3$;  $s_X = 2$;  $s.e. = 0.75$.

If one wants to estimate his y score with 95% confidence for a 4-year-old child, the width of the estimation interval is equal to:
