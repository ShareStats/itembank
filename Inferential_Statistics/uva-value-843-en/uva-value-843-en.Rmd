========

The probability that the coin is fair (pure) is considered. It is assumed that the coin is fair and it is assumed that the probability of coin (or head) is 0.5. 100 tosses are made and with this number of tosses it is assumed that the central limit theorem can be used can be used. It is found that 55 times coin comes out on top out of 100 throws, a proportion of 55/100 = 0.55. The researchers want to know the probability of this proportion being 0.55 or greater than unexpected. That probability is
