Question
========

In a study with only 5 subjects, the Wilcoxon test is is used to compare two groups. In group 1, 3 subjects are randomly placed and in group 2, 2 subjects are randomly placed. The difference in mean rank is used to compare the two groups comparison. The null hypothesis states that the mean rank order is the same for both groups, and the alternative hypothesis that group 1 has a lower mean rank than group 2. For the comparison used: group 1 - group 2 (group 1 minus group 2). The difference in mean rankings from the sample is -0.8. Given the exact probability distribution shown below, what is now the P-value?
