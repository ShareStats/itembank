Question
========
Suppose the population average of hours worked per week per person is
40.2 hours, with a population standard deviation of 0.4 hours. Suppose
that you draw samples from this population (with a sample size of 40).  
  
Between which two values 95% of the sample mean will be?

Answerlist
----------
* 38.94; 41.47
* 39.40; 41.00
* 40.07; 40.33
* 40.14; 40.26
* 38.24; 42.16

Solution
========





You can calculate this with the following formula: CI for mean y
+/-* t(se) *with *se* = *s / √n*  
  
Thus: 40.2 +/- 1.96 \* (0.4 / √40) = (40.07; 40.33)
