Question
========
We analyze data obtained from high school students in secondary education from the Youth & Culture Data (Ganzeboom & Nagel, 1998-2002). For this database, over 3,000 young people were surveyed in the age from roughly 14 to 17 years of age.    
  
In the regression analysis below, participation in popular culture is is the dependent variable (pjcul: 1-100, from little to a lot of participation) and the independent variables are gender (female: 0-1, 0= boy, 1 = girl) and maternal cultural participation (pmcul: 0-1, from least to most culturally active). In addition, an interaction added between gender and mothers' cultural participation (female pmcul).

What conclusion can you draw from model 2 about the population of schoolchildren?  
1: The effect of gender on participation in popular culture is larger for schoolchildren with highly culturally active mothers than for schoolchildren with few culturally active mothers 2: For pupils of the least culturally active mothers, there are no differences in participation in popular culture between boys and girls
