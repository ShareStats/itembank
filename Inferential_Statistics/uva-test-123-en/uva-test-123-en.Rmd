Question
========

In a study of the difference between having or not having a time limit in solving problems, 28 subjects are examined. Each subject completes both a set of (similar) problems with and without a time limit. The score on the test is approximately normally distributed. Then difference scores are calculated with mean 3.21 and variance 2.53. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between having or not having a time limit, and the alternative hypothesis that there is a difference.
