Question
========
In order to select new personnel the police-force uses a procedure in which applicants are rated on three continuous scales: stress-resistance, sociability, and intelligence. To study the validity of this procedure a random sample of police officers is rated on these three psychological scales. Additionally, their supervisor rates their overall functioning on a scale ranging from 0 (poor functioning) to 100 (excellent functioning).

A researcher wants to know whether stress-resistance and sociability together explain a significant proportion of the variation in overall functioning after controlling for intelligence. 
Which analysis technique is most suited for this purpose?

Answerlist
----------
* Hierarchical regression analysis
* Multiple regression analysis (method: enter)
* Mixed ANOVA
* ANCOVA


Solution
========
Hierarchical regression analysis is the correct answer. You want to know what the effect is of two continuous variables on overall functioning when controlling for a third continuous variable. Out of these options, only a hierarchical regression will give an answer to this question through R-squared change. 

A multiple regression analysis would only test for a general effect (explained variance) and would not control for a specific variable. 

Mixed ANOVA is irrelevant as there is no mix of between- and within-subjects factors.

An ANCOVA is also not relevant here. You use an ANCOVA when you want to look at the effect of a categorical independent variable on a continuous dependent variable, while controlling for another continuous variable (covariate) that covariates with the dependent variable. In this case, there is no categorical independent variable.
