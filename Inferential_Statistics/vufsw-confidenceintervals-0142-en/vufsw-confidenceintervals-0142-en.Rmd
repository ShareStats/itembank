Question
========
Suppose a researcher administered to 102 employees of a large company a questionnaire that surveyed how they rated their supervisor rating. The scores ranged from 0 (very negative) to 5 (very positive). It is tested whether people with a permanent contract ______[group 2; n=51] rate their supervisor more positively than those with a temporary contract （group 1; n=51）. He calculates the 95% confidence interval of the difference in averages, µ<sub>1</sub> - µ<sub>2</sub>. This interval turns out to be µ[-0.03; 0.08] are.  
  
Do the mean ratings of the two groups differ significantly from each other? We test two-sided and use a significance level of 5%. And from what can this conclusion be derived?

Answerlist
----------
* Yes, because the number 0.00 lies within the interval.
* No, because the number 0.00 lies within the interval.
* No, because the number 0.025 lies within the interval.
* No, because the number 0.05 lies within the interval.
* Yes, because the number 0.025 lies within the interval.
