Question
========
We analyze data obtained from high school students in secondary education from the Youth & Culture Data (Ganzeboom & Nagel, 1998-2002). For this database, over 3,000 young people were surveyed in the age from roughly 14 to 17 years of age. In the regression analysis below, the participation in popular culture is the dependent variable (pjcul: 0-100, from little to much participation) and the independent variables maternal cultural participation (pmcul: 0-1, from least to most culturally active) and school level (in dummies, reference group = vmbo-b). Interactions between mothers' cultural participation and school level.

What conclusion can you draw from model 2 about the population of schoolchildren?  
1: Vmbo-b students engage in popular culture less than grammar school students with similarly culturally active mothers. 2: For grammar school students, the more the mother is involved in culture, they themselves do less popular culture.
