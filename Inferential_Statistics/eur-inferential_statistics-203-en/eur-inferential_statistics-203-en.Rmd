Question
========
Calculate the 95% Confidence Interval of a student who has a grade of 5.2 given a reliability of .81 for the exam. The variance of the grades is 4
Formula for the 95% confidence interval: $95\% CI = X_o ± Z_{p=95} \times se_m$
Formula for standard error of measurement is: $se_m = s_o \times \sqrt{1 - R_{xx}}$


Solution
========
You will need the formula for the 95% confidence interval: $95\% CI = X_o ± Z_{p=95} \times se_m$

$95\% CI = 5.2 ± 1.96 \times se_m$

$se_m = 2 \times \sqrt {1-.81} = .872$

$95\% CI = 5.2 ± 1.96 \times .872 = 5.2 ± 1.71$

The 95% CI of grade 5.2 is $[3.49-6.93]$
