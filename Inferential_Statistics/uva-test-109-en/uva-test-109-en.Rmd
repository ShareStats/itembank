Question
========

Researchers are interested in the relationship between problem behavior at school (*y*) and problem behavior at the nursery (*x*) of children. After collecting data for 42 children, they calculate they calculate the regression line *y* = 2 + 3*x*. They do a test on the slope parameter to establish the relationship between *x* and *y*. The standard error of the slope parameter is 1.5 and the number of degrees of freedom with which to test is 40. The null hypothesis states that the slope parameter is 0. This null hypothesis is tested against the alternative hypothesis which states that the slope parameter does not equal 0. The null hypothesis can be
