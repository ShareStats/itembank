Question
========
If you were researching the effect of *hours* of training and
*attitude *on the performance of a specific skill (e.g. the number of
goals scored: *performance*), and the regression results give you the
following regression equation, which of the following statements is
true?  
*p**e**r**f**o**r**m**a**n**c**e* = 1.23<sup>\*</sup> + 0.112 × *a**t**t**i**t**u**d**e* + 0.531<sup>\*</sup> × *h**o**u**r**s* + 0.167<sup>\*</sup> × *a**t**t**i**t**u**d**e* × *h**o**u**r**s*  
  
  
\* indicates a statistically significant effect

Answerlist
----------
* When the athlete’s attitude is positive there is a positive significant
  relationship between hours of training and sports performance.
* When the athlete’s attitude is positive there is a positive
  non-significant relationship between hours of training and sports
  performance.
* When the athlete’s attitude is positive there is a negative significant
  relationship between hours of training and sports performance.
* When the athlete’s attitude is positive there is a negative
  non-significant relationship between hours of training and sports
  performance.

*p**e**r**f**o**r**m**a**n**c**e* = 1.23<sup>\*</sup> + 0.112 × *a**t**t**i**t**u**d**e* + 0.531<sup>\*</sup> × *h**o**u**r**s* + 0.167<sup>\*</sup> × *a**t**t**i**t**u**d**e* × *h**o**u**r**s*  
  
The effect of hours on performance is:  
  
(0.531 + 0.167\*attitude). If *attitude *is positive, this number will
always be positive. Since both the coefficient of the main effect of
*hours* and the interaction effect are statistically significant, we
expect the effect of *hours* to be always significant if *attitude* is
positive.

----------
* True
* False
* False
* False
