Question

The researchers want to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference between boys and girls in preference for a teacher.


To test the null hypothesis that there is no difference between boys and girls in preference for a teacher or master, a chi-square test is done. As the test size, the value $\chi^2$ = 30,957 found.

What do we know about the p-value of this test?


  
Answerlist
----------
* The p-value is greater than .10
* The p-value is somewhere between .05 and .10
* The p-value is somewhere between .025 and .05
* The p-value is less than .01
