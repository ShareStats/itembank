Question
========
  
In a study of the influence of teaching methods for reading comprehension on students' reading performance (variable Y), the following methods are distinguished: 1 = Learn to read safely. 2 = Good reading! 3 = Text Processing.

In the analysis, in addition to teaching method (M), one includes gender (S) and nonverbal intelligence (N, scale with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15) as control variables.

Which of the regression equations below applies to this situation (D = dummy)?

  
Answerlist
----------
* $\hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1N + b_2S + b_3M + e$
* $\hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1N + b_2D_1 + b_3D_2 + b_4D_3 + b_5D_4 $
* $\hat{Y} = b_1N  + b_2S_1 + b_3M + e$
* $\hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1N + b_2S_1 + b_3D_2 + b_4D_3$
