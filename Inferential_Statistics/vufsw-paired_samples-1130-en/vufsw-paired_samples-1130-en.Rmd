Question
========
In an experiment, 20 randomly selected subjects received training to
improve their mathematics skills. Their performance was measured before
the training took place (measurement 1) and afterwards (measurement 2)
on a scale of 1 to 10. A higher score means better performance. The
results are shown below. A researcher wants to investigate whether the
training increases the score and performs a one-sided test with alpha =
0.05.  
  
  

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>N               </td>
<td>mean measurement 1  (before)</td>
<td>  mean measurement 2 (afterwards)</td>
<td>mean difference</td>
<td>standard error (se) mean difference</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>20</td>
<td>5.75                                                </td>
<td>6.35                                                       </td>
<td>0.60                               </td>
<td>0.24</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

  
  
The researcher states that these are two independent groups, so a
dependent *t*-test is required. Explain why.

Answerlist
----------
* Because the training in this study probably has a positive influence on
  the performance.
* Because the training in the population probably has a positive influence
  on the performance.
* Because the researcher took two measurements in the same group of
  subjects.
* Because it cannot be excluded that a significant result in the sample is
  due to coincidence.

Solution
========





Whether the measurements are dependent or independent has nothing to do
with whether there is or there is not an association between the X and
the Y. The researcher took two measurements **in the same group of
subjects. T**he measurements are NOT independent (if a person scores at
the beginning high on mathematics skills he or she will also score high
at the second measurement, regardless of the intervention), therefore
the two measurements are not independent and THUS is a dependent
*t-*test is required.
