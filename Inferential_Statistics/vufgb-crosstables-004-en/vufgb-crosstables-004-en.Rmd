Answerlist
----------
* 4
* 16
* 20
* 40

Solution
========

The unstandardized residual is the difference between the observed frequency in a cell and the expected frequency in a cell under the null hypothesis of no relationship between two categorical variables in a crosstab. The observed frequency for the cell Separated-Low educated is 20. The expected frequency under the null hypothesis is given by the product of the row and column totals of the cell divided by the total $N: \; 80 \times 48 \div 240 = 16$.

The unstandardized residue is then thus $20-16 = 4$.
