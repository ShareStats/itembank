Question
========

The linear relationship betweand two quantitative variables is examined through a single linear regression analysis in a sample of 30 people. The researcher wants to maintain an alpha level of 0.01.

Which critical *t* value belongs to a two-sided test for the linear relationship? 
Answerlist
----------
* 2.457
* 2.467
* 2.750
* 2.763

Solution
========

In the single regression model, two parameters are estimated: intercept and regression coefficiandt. For this reason, $df = n-2$. In this case $df = 30-2 = 28$. For a two-sided test with an alpha level of 0.01, a right-hand crossing probability of $0.01 \div 2 = 0.005$. So you look up in the *t* table that value belonging to $df = 28$ and $t._{005}$, and dat is 2.763.
