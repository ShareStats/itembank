Question
========
We analyse whether the performance of pupils differs between 3 subjects:
literature, essay writing and mathematics (they are in this order in the
data set). In addition, we investigate whether any differences between
the 3 subjects vary between male and female students. Therefore, we use
a Mixed Design ANOVA. The output of this analysis is shown below. Female
is coded as 0: male, 1: female.

Which Mean Square Model do we use in the F-test that tests whether there
is an interaction between pupils' performance in the 3 subjects and
gender?  
*Round to three decimal places.*


Solution
========





Dit is de Mean Square Model van de interactie met Sphericity Assumed (de
Mauchly's test is niet significant) in de tabel van Within-subject
effects.
