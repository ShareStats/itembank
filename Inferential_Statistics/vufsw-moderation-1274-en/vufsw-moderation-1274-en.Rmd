Question
========
A researcher has drawn a sample among children who have been playing a
musical instrument for five years. He investigated whether the number of
hours a child exercised with the instrument per week influenced the
number of musical exams that the child had achieved (in total there were
8 exams, the first exam being the easiest and the last exam the most
difficult; graph expressed with level of musical skill). The children
were also asked if their parents were very strict when it came to
practicing (whether or not 'pushy'/ strict). What does the regression
chart below show ?

Answerlist
----------
* The more a child exercised, the more music exams the child made. This
  relationship was stronger for the children who had strict parents
  compared to the children who did not have strict parents.
* The more a child exercised, the more music exams the child made. This
  relationship was stronger for the children who did not have strict
  parents, compared to the children who had severe parents.
* Children with strict parents received more music exams than the children
  who did not have strict parents. This relationship was stronger for
  children who exercised a lot, compared with children who did not
  exercise very much.
* Children with strict parents had more music exams than the children who
  did not have strict parents. This relationship was stronger for children
  who practiced little, compared with children who practiced a lot.

Solution
========





The right answer is; he more a child exercised, the more music exams the
child made. This relationship was stronger for the children who had
