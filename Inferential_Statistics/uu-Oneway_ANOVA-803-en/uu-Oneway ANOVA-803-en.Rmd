Question
========

Many secondary school teachers struggle with the question of how to deal with disturbances. Commonly used light sanctions like warning have little effect on the disturbance, and heavy sanctions like removal from class sometimes backfire because they can lead to status enhancement of the affected student. One study examined the effect on classroom calm of a new type of sanction, the writing task. This requires students to write an essay about their own behavior. In this experiment, three groups were distinguished: teachers who merely warned students (repeatedly), teachers who removed students from class in case of disorder, and teachers who gave students a writing task. The number of disturbances two weeks after the intervention was examined.

Reported is F(2, 20) = 5.80. What do we know about the excess probability (p-value) of this test?
