Question
========
Do your music tastes change as you get older? Field expects so and investigates this by distinguishing in an experiment two age groups young adults under 40 and older adults over 40. (variable: age). Both age groups are also randomly divided into three smaller groups, and these have to listen to music by Fugazo, Abba, or Barf Grooks (variable: music). Each participant rates the music on a scale of -100 to +100 (variable: liking; a higher score means higher "liking").
