Question
========
Marco works as a dog therapist and has a group of fifteen dogs with separation anxiety under his care. He develops a three-month dog relaxation therapy that he tests on five of the fifteen dogs. The ten remaining dogs are divided into a group that receives calming medication for three months and a control group.  
Marco then measures weekly the number of minutes it takes until the dogs start barking after the owner leaves the house. He expects the "time to first bark" of the group of dogs on relaxation therapy to increase significantly faster than that of both other groups. What analysis does he use to test this expectation?
