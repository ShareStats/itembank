Question
========
According to a survey of 55 men and 68 women of LINDA Magazine (February
2016), women cry 30 to 64 times a year, while men only cry between 6 and
17 times a year. Suppose the population mean "number of times to cry"
for women is 45, with a standard deviation of 8. What is the z-score of
a woman who cries 15 times a year?

Answerlist
----------
* -1.88
* -3.75
* -7.00
* -30.92
* -6.63

Solution
========





To **calculate** the **z**-**score**, you will **find** the difference
between aÂ **value** in the sample and the mean, and divide it by the
standard deviation. Thus  
(15 - 45) / 8 = -3.75


Answerlist
----------
* False
* True
* False
* False
* False
