Question
========
A teacher is interested in the effect of the number of study hours
(HOURS) on the score on a specific test (SCORE). He carries out a
regression with these two variables and with a random sample of 160
students.  
  
This leads to the following regression equation: SCORE = 2.30 + 0.80 \*
HOURS.  
  
The teacher wants to conclude that HOURS have a positive effect on
SCORE. He runs a two-sided test with a significance level of 5% (α =
0,05). What does he need to test exactly?

Answerlist
----------
* He should test whether the value of 0.80 differs significantly from
  0.00.
* He should test whether the value of 0.80 differs significantly from
  0.05.
* He should test whether the value of 0.80 differs significantly from
  0.025.
* He should test whether the value of 0.80 differs significantly from
  0.95.
* HiHe should test whether the value of 0.80 differs significantly from
