The probability that the coin is fair (pure) is considered. It is assumed that the coin is fair and it is assumed that the probability of coin (or head) is 0.5. There are 250 tosses and with this number of tosses it is assumed that the central limit theorem can be used can be used. It is found that 140 times coin comes out on top of the 250 throws, a proportion of 140/250 = 0.56. The researchers want to know the probability of this proportion being 0.56 or greater than unexpected. That probability is
