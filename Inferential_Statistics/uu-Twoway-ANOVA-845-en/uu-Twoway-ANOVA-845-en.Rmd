Answerlist
----------
* Diagram B
* Diagram C
* Diagram D
* Diagram A


Solution
========
The table shows that there is no main effect of Gender (p = .536). However, there is a main effect of relationship (p < .001) and also an interaction effect (p = .007). Mean diagrams B and D drop out immediately, here there is no interaction effect (the lines are parallel). In the remaining mean diagrams, it is necessary to examine which main effect is present. Below is that gained, blue represents the main effect of Gender. Red represents the main effect of Relationship. Recall that it is examined whether the lines are at the same height of the y-axis!

Judging from these lines, it can be concluded that in Average Diagram A, a main effect of Relationship is depicted. And in Average Diagram C, a main effect of Gender is depicted. For this reason, Average Diagram A is appropriate for the table.
