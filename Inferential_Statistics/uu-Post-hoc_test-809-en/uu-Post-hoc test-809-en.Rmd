Question
========
A researcher is conducting a large-scale study in which he wants to compare the average test scores of 8 different groups. The results have been reported as follows:

The differences between the group averages were significant, F(7, 334) = 4.67, p < .001, $\eta^2$ = .116.  Now a post hoc test shows that different groups do not show significant differences among themselves, so the researcher decides to merge some groups and compare only 4 more groups (though with the same sample size).

What are the degrees of freedom to be reported in this new comparison?

Answerlist
----------
* 4 and 337
* 3 and 330
* 3 and 338
* 4 and 331


Solution
========
First, the researcher had 8 groups. $Df_{between}$ = k - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7. $Df_{within}$ = N - k = N - 8 = 334$. Dus N = 342.

Bij het vergelijken van 4 groepen krijgen we dan: $df_{between}$ = k - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3. $Df_{within}$ = N - k = 342 - 4 = 338.
