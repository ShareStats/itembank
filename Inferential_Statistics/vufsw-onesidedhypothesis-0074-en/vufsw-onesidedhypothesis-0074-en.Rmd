Question
========
One survey included the following question on the extent to which a person has confidence in the police. This variable is called "**Police**".  
  
Respondents also answered questions about their origin. According to the CBS definition, a person has a migration background if this person, or one of the parents, was born in another country. On the basis this, the researcher created the dummy variable "**Migration background" **constructed (1=respondent has a migration background; 0=respondent has no migration background).  
  
It expects people with a migration background to have less trust have in the police than people without a migration background and formulates the following null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) and alternative hypothesis (H<sub>a</sub>):  H<sub>0</sub>: the average degree of trust in the police of people with a migration background does *not* differ from the average degree of trust in the police of people without a migration background.  
H<sub>a</sub>: the average degree of trust in the police of people with a migration background is *lower* than the average degree of trust in the police of people without a migration background.  
  
Will the researcher conduct a two-sided or one-sided test?

Answerlist
----------
* A one-sided test because "Migration background" is a dense variable (a dummy variable).
* A one-sided test, because the researcher provides a direction to the alternative hypothesis.
* A two-sided test, because in this case we are comparing two groups comparing (people with a migration background and people without a migration background).
* A two-sided test, because the researcher does *not* indicate a direction at the null hypothesis.
