Question
========
  
Several programs are used in elementary schools to teach children how to get along with each other and to make them aware of the consequences of bullying. Four of these programs were compared in a recent study:
- KiVa -- an anti-bullying program from Finland
- PRIMA -- PRoefImpleMentation Anti-Bullying Policy in Primary Education
- VS - Peaceful School
- SVO - Safe Education Foundation A measure of mutual tolerance was used as an indication of program effectiveness. Part of the SPSS output is below.

TRUE is the correct value of the F-ratio and the associated degrees of freedom? When calculating the intermediate steps, use 3 decimal places / 3 decimal places. 
Answerlist
----------
* F(3, 43) = 6.00
* F(3, 43) = 0.17
* F(4, 42) = 4.39
* F(4, 42) = 0.23 


Solution
========
$df_{tussen}$ = number of groups - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 and $df_{inside}$ = $df_{total}$ - $df_{tussen}$ = 46 - 3 = 43. With this, the MS = SS / df can be calculated from the SS:
$MS_{tussen}$ = 16.29 / 3 = 5.430; $MS_{inside}$ = 38.93 / 43 ≈ 0.905. It follows that F = $MS_{tussen}$ /  $MS_{binnen}$ = 5.430 / 0.905 = 6.00.
