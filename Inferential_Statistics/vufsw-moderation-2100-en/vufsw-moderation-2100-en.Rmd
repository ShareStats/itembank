Question
========
We analyze data obtained from high school students in secondary education from the Youth & Culture Data (Ganzeboom & Nagel, 1998-2002). For this database, over 3,000 young people were surveyed in the age from roughly 14 to 17 years of age. In the regression analysis below, the participation in popular culture is the dependent variable (pjcul: 0-100, from little to much participation) and the independent variables maternal cultural participation (pmcul: 0-1, from least to most culturally active) and school level (in dummies, reference group = vmbo-b). In addition, interactions were added in Model 3 between mothers' cultural participation and school level.![](Schermafbeelding__2019-02-04__om__10.54.16.png)

What conclusion can you draw from model 3 about the population of schoolchildren?  
1: At higher school levels, differences in participation in popular culture between students with low and highly culturally active mother are not stronger than at lower school levels 2: Differences in participation in popular culture between students of different school levels depend on the cultural activity of the mother
