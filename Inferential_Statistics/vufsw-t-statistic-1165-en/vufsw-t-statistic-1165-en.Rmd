Question
========
A researcher wants to test whether people lose weight after using a
product that would lead to weight reduction. Suppose that on average a
decrease in weight (measured in kilograms) is indeed found.  
  
When could one conclude that the product actually leads to weight
reduction?

Answerlist
----------
* When the absolute t value found is greater than the absolute critical t
  value.
* When the absolute t value found is less than the absolute critical t
  value.
* When the found t value is 0.
* When the critical t value is 0.

Solution
========





We can conclude that the product actually leads to weight reduction when
the absolute t value found is greater than the absolute critical t
value.
