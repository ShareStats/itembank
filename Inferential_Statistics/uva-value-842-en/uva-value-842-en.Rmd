The probability that the coin is fair (pure) is considered. It is assumed that the coin is fair and it is assumed that the probability of coin (or head) is 0.5. There are 30 tosses and with this number of tosses it is assumed that the central limit theorem can be used can be used. It is found that 18 times coin comes out on top of the 30 throws, a proportion of 18/30 = 0.60. The researchers want to know the probability of this proportion being 0.60 or greater than unexpected. That probability is
