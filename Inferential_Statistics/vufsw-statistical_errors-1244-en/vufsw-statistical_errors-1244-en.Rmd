Question
========
Suppose that 10 researchers each independently draw a random sample from
the same population. The samples are smaller than the population and do
not include the entire population. Suppose they calculate a point
estimate on this basis. What can you say about the point estimates of
the various researchers?

Answerlist
----------
* The point estimates are always equal to each other
* The point estimates are equal to each other if the samples are the same
  size.
* The larger the samples, the closer the point estimates are likely to be.
* The smaller the samples, the closer the point estimates are likely to
  be.

Solution
========





Â The larger the samples, the closer the point estimates are likely to
be.
