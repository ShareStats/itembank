Question
========

Fat percentage can be estimated using (the logarithm of) the sum of the skinfold thicknesses of biceps and triceps.______________________ Attached is a scatterplot plotting both of these variables against each other.ÃŠ The equation of the corresponding regression line reads:

Answerlist
----------

* Percentage of fat = 5 + 24 x log(skinfold thickness)
* Percentage of fat = 9 + 19 x log(skinfold thickness)
* Percentage fat = -13 + 25 x log(skinfold thickness)
* Percentage of fat = -6 + 17 x log(skinfold thickness)

Solution
========

Answerlist
----------

* Fat percentage = 5 + 24 x log(skinfold thickness): Incorrect
* Fat percentage = 9 + 19 x log(skinfold thickness): Incorrect
* Fat percentage = -13 + 25 x log(skinfold thickness): Incorrect
* Fat percentage = -6 + 17 x log(skinfold thickness): Correct
