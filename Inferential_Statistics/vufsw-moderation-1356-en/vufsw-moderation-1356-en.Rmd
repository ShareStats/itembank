Question
========
Field describes a study on the growing interest in cosmetic surgical treatments. He collected data on the quality of life among a sample of respondents some of whom some had undergone cosmetic surgery and some were still on the waiting list for it. waiting list for it (variable: surgery: 0 = waiting list, 1 = cosmetic surgery). It measured the quality of life at registration for the cosmetic surgery, the "baseline" quality of life (variable: Base_Qol, scale 0-1, a higher score means higher quality of quality of life) and after a while, after the surgery had taken place for those who underwent the surgery immediately, but also at the same time for the group who were still on the waiting list (variable: Post\_Qol, scale 0-100, a higher score means a higher quality of life).  
  
Below are the results of a regression analysis with the post-measurement of quality of life as the dependent variable (Post-QOL), and in which having or not having undergone the cosmetic surgery (Surgery) and the "baseline" quality of life (Base_Qol) in the model are included. Moreover, in model 2, the interaction between 'surgery' and 'baseline' quality of life were added to the model (Base_Qol_surgery).

According to **model 2**, how much higher or lower is the quality of life (Post_Qol) of the group who underwent the cosmetic surgery than that of the group still on the waiting list, for those with a very low (0) the "baseline" quality of life?

Answerlist
----------
* 31,142 points lower on the 0-100 scale of Post_Qol
* 8,494 points higher on the 0-100 scale of Post\_Qol
* 26,382 points higher on the 0-100 scale of Post_Qol
* 17,888 points higher on the 0-100 scale of Post\_Qol
