Question
========
The table below is taken from an article by Hilde Coffé from 2013.  
Look at the column of the variable "**Politics**". This dependent variable measures one's interest in politics, measured on a scale that runs from 1 ("not at all interested") to 4 ("very interested").  
  
We want to know the effect of gender. The dummy variable "**Female**" (see first row in the table) is coded as follows: 0=male; 1=female. How should we interpret the b coefficient of -0.114 that reflects the effect represents the effect of gender on the level of interest in politics ("**Politics**")?
