Question
========
Which of the following is **not **one of the **dis**advantages of Baron
and Kenny's method to assess mediation?

Answerlist
----------
* Baron and Kenny rely too much on the statistical significance of *c* and
  *c'*
* Baron and Kenny suggest the testing of the significance of *a *and *b*.
  However, mediation is assessed by the significance of the indirect
  effect *ab* which is not the same as testing of the significance of
  *a *and *b *separately.
* The condition that a total effect *c* should exist is not necessary
* The condition that an indirect effect *ab* should exist is not necessary

Solution
========





The three disadvantages of the Baron and Kenny method are the
following:  
  
1. Baron and Kenny rely too much on the statistical significance of c
and c'. So, if c'=.5 (P=0.049) we conclude that there is mediation while
if c'=.5 (P=0.051), we conclude that there is no mediation  
  
2. Baron and Kenny suggest the testing of the significance of *a *and
*b*. However, mediation is assessed by the significance of the indirect
effect *ab* which is not the same as testing of the significance of
*a *and *b *separately.  
  
3. The condition that a total effect *c* should exist is not necessary.
This is the case in suppression.   
  
Therefore the option "*The condition that the indirect effect ab should
exist is not necessary*" is the correct answer

Answerlist
----------
* False
* False
* False
* True
