Question
========

An experiment measures reaction times while cycling when using a cell phone (yes/no). Subjects (N = 32) performed the task in both conditions. The mean reaction times were 534.6 milliseconds (SD = 66.45) without phone, and 585.2 milliseconds (SD = 89.65) with phone. The mean difference was 50.63 (SD = 52.49), t(31) = 5.46, $p < .001$.

What is the corresponding effect size?
