amount of litter per m2. A t-test is used for this study. What is the
null hypothesis of this research?

* The average amount of litter in both the Netherlands and Germany is 0.
* The average amount of litter in the samples of both the Netherlands and
  Germany is unknown.
* There is a difference in the average amount of litter between the
  Netherlands and Germany.
* There is no difference in the average amount of litter between the
  Netherlands and Germany.

There is no difference in the average amount of litter between the
Netherlands and Germany.

average amount of litter between the Netherlands and Germany, more in
the Netherlands than in Germany in this example.  
H<sub>a\  \  </sub>Mean<sub> Netherlands </sub> &gt;   Mean
