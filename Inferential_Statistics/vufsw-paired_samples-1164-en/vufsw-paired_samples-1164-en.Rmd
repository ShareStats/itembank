Question
========
The medical faculty of the VU conducts a study into the effectiveness of
a product that should lead to weight reduction. For this purpose, the
weight (in kilograms) for the use of the product is compared with the
weight in a group of 20 people after the product has been used for three
weeks by the persons examined.  
  
Why should the Independent t-test **not** be used for this analysis?

Answerlist
----------
* The weight is not measured on a ratio scale.
* The researcher's hypothesis is that the product is effective, so that
  the degree of weight reduction and the use of the product are not
  independent of each other.
* The two samples that are compared are the same persons, so they are not
  independent of each other.
* The two samples that are compared are measured by the same faculty, so
  they are not independent of each other.

Solution
========





Because it are the same people the sample is not independent.  
The two samples that are compared are the same persons, so they are not
independent of each other.
