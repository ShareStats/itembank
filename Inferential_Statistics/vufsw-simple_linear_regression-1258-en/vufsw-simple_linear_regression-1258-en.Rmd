Question
========
A researcher wants to know how much beer students drink during a night
out. He is curious whether the money a student has to spend per month
(in euros) has an influence on the amount of alcohol that the student
drinks (measured in the number of glasses of alcohol). Which statistical
test or technique is most suitable for testing this?

Answerlist
----------
* Dependent t-test
* Chi-square test
* Simple regression
* Reliability test

Solution
========





Â It is a simple regression.  
  
The dependent t-test (also called the paired t-test or paired-samples
t-test) compares the means of two related groups to determine whether
there is a statistically significant difference between these means.  
  
The chi-squared test is used to determine whether there is a significant
difference between the expected frequencies and the observed frequencies
in one or more categories.  
  
Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to
summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative)
variables.  
  
Reliability in scientific investigation usually means the stability and
repeatability of measures, or the ability of a test to produce the same
results under the same conditions
