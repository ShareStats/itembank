Question
========

Suppose a researcher has four averages for which she wants to calculate multiple comparison Tukey confidence intervals wants to calculate. With four averages a total of six possible differences between averages and therefore six confidence intervals. For comparison, the researcher also calculates comparison also calculates the ordinary 95% confidence intervals. Two of these ordinary 95% confidence intervals are (3; 7) and (12; 16). What are now possible Tukey 95% confidence intervals that correspond to the above two ordinary confidence intervals?
