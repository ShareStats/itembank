Question
========

Suppose it is known that a 0.001 proportion of Dutch women have disease *D*. There is a test to detect this disease. That test is not always reliable: in 0.05 of the cases in which the person has the disease, the test gives the result Òno disease = negative result'. 0.95 of such patients are detected with a positive result. Furthermore, a person who does not have the disease gets a negative result in 0.95 of the cases. What is the probability if you randomly choose a woman, that she has the disease *D*, given that her test has a positive test result?
