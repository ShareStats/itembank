Question
========
For her master's thesis, a student used an experimental design to investigate whether subjects who had to read an unfavorable news report had to read a less positive assessment regarding a particular company's image than subjects who read a neutral news item read. The rating was measured on a scale from 1 (very negative) to 5 (very positive).  
  
The results show that the average rating of the two groups is as follows (see below)  The one-sided hypothesis of the researcher is that the mean rating of the experimental group is significantly lower than that of the control group. She uses a significance level for this test of 5% (α = .05).  
  
What is the **observed absolute t value**? (rounded to 2 decimals)
