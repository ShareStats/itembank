Question
========

Suppose it is known that a proportion of 0.002 of Dutch women have disease *D*. There is a test to detect this disease. That test is not always reliable: in 0.04 of the cases in which the person has the disease, the test gives the result "no disease" with a negative result. And 0.96 of them are detected with a positive result. Furthermore: in 0.96 of those who do not have it, the test gives a negative result. Marja is told that she has a negative test result.

Set the events:

* *D* = The disease *D*,
* *N* = The negative test result.

Then what is the probability P(*D* and *N*) that Marja gets a negative test result and she also has the disease?
