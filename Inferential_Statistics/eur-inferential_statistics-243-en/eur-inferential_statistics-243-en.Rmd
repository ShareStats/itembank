Question
========
Feyenoord and Ajax fans often criticize each other's teams. We will be looking at what team a person is a fan of [Fan, where Feyenoord = 0 and Ajax = 1], in what city a person lives [City, where Rotterdam = 1, Amsterdam = 2, Dordrecht = 3 and Haarlem = 4], the number of games played by the favourite team that they watched over the years (so the amount of games played by Feyenoord watched by a Feyenoord fan) [played_favourite] and to the amount of games played by the other team that someone watched over the years [played_other]. We also registered whose team became division champion in the last 4 years [Champion, where No championship = 0 and Championship = 1].

If the championship has been won [Champion=1], what is chance that this was the case for a Feyenoord fan [Fan]? Report the probability, not the percentage. (using 2 decimals).
