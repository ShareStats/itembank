Question
========
A teacher is interested in how the number of hours that students have studied ("**HOURS**") on the score on a particular test ("**SCORE**"). He conducts a regression analysis with these two variables, using data from a sample of 160 students.  
  
This leads to the following linear model: SCORE = 2.30 + 0.80 \* HOURS.  
  
The teacher wants to determine whether UREN has a positive influence on SCORE. He tests two-way with a 5% significance level (α = 0.05). What should the teacher test in this case?

Answerlist
----------
* He should check whether the value 0.80 is significantly different from 0.00.
* He should check whether the value 0.80 is significantly different from 0.05.
* He must verify that the value 0.80 is significantly different from 0.025.
* He must verify that the value 0.80 is significantly smaller than 0.95.
* He must verify that the value 0.80 is significantly smaller than 1.96.
