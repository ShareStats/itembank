Solution
========
  
p < .01 means that the probability that the difference in mean is based on chance is very small and therefore significant. However, it says nothing about the magnitude of the difference. In very large samples and with small differences within the samples, even a very small difference in mean can be significant. And if you don't know how big the difference is, it's hard to say anything about relevance.
