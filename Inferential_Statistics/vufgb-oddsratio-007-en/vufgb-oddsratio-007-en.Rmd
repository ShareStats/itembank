Question
========
  
A logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between bullying (x; higher score is more bullied) and school dropout (y; 0=not; 1=well). The odds of the probability of school dropout for a score x=6 is 0.18, and for a score x=7 it is 0.33. Calculate the odds ratio.

Formula for the odds ratio:

$\theta = \frac{\frac{\pi_{1}}{(1-\pi_{1})}}{\frac{\pi_{2}}{(1-\pi_{2})}}$
