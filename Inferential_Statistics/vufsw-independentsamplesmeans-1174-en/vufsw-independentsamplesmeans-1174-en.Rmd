H<sub>0</sub>: mean1 - mean2 = 0  
H<sub>a</sub>: mean1 - mean2 is not equal to 0  
  
Draw conclusions about the hypotheses with a significance level of .01
(alpha = 1%).

Answerlist
----------
* We can reject the null hypothesis, since the absolute observed t-value
  is greater than the critical t-value.
* We can not reject the null hypothesis, since the absolute observed
  t-value is greater than the critical t-value.
* We can reject the null hypothesis, since the absolute observed t-value
  is less than the critical t-value.
* We can not reject the null hypothesis, since the absolute observed
  t-value is less than the critical t-value.

Solution
========





We can reject the null hypothesis, since the absolute observed t-value
is greater than the critical t-value.  
We can calculate the t value with:  
  
Compare means: (ȳ<sub>2</sub> - ȳ<sub>1</sub>) ± *t*(*se*) with *se* =
sqrt \[ (*s*<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> / *n*<sub>1</sub>) +
(*s*<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> / *n<sub>2</sub>*) \]  
Test *H*<sub>0</sub> : *μ*1 = *μ*2 using *t* = (ȳ<sub>2</sub> -
ȳ<sub>1</sub>) / *se*
