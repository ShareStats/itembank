Question
========
  
Isa wishes to compare the prices of apartments in two neighboring towns using a significance level of 5%. She takes a random sample of 12 apartments in town A and calculates the average price of these apartments ($M = 850$, $SD = 85$). She repeats this for 15 apartments in town B ($M = 825$, $SD = 75$). Let $\mu_A$ represent the true average price of apartments in town A and $\mu_B$ the average price in town B.

The $t$-value turns out to be $t = 0.811$ with a $p$-value of $.425$. Isa could have made a Type I error.
