Question
========
The analyses below were carried out on data from a sample of young
adults aged between 20 and 40 years who were interviewed via a
questionnaire asking about their cultural preferences. The research
questions are (1) to what extent the amount of television viewing
(variable: TVWatching (scale 0-1): a higher score means that more TV is
watched) is caused by the social position of the parental environment
(measured is the education of the parents (variable: FAMEDUC (scale
0-7), ranging from primary education (0) to university (7) a higher
score means a higher education) and (2) whether this relationship can be
explained by the extent to which television used to be watched (when the
respondent was 12 years old) by the parents (variable: FAMTV (scale
0-1), a higher score means that more television was watched).  
Below are the results of two regression analyses.

What is the indirect effect (mediation effect) of 'fameduc' through
'famtv' on 'tvwatching' (use the unstandardized coefficients)?Â   
*Just give a number in three decimal places, nothing else.*
