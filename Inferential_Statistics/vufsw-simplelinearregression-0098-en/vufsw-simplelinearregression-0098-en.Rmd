Question
========
An instructor is interested in how the number of hours that students have studied ("**HOURS**") on the examination grade ("**GRADE**"). He conducts a regression analysis with these two variables, using data from a sample of 60 students.  
  
Given is the following linear model for this relationship: DIGIT = 2.80 + 0.30 ________* HOURS.  
  
In a regression, we assume a ***linear*** relationship between X and Y. What does this assumption of linearity imply for the above model?

Answerlist
----------
* E assume that the number of HOURS will affect CIJFER, *but not the other way around*.
* Hat means we expect the influence of HOURS on CIFFER to be *the same* for any comparable increase in the number of HOURS will be *the same*.
* Hat is, we expect the influence of HOURS on CIFFER to be will be *positive*.
* E expect the effect to be true for *all* students in our sample.
