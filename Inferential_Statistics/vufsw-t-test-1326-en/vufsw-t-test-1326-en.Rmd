Question
========
In an experiment on the effect of food marketing on purchase intentions (Laura Sjardin, Josephine Ruijs, Nora Michon and Lianne van der Poel, 2017), 182 respondents were given a picture on Instagram of a healthy "juice" (fruit juice). The respondents were randomly divided into two groups: half were shown a photo of the juice that had 28 likes; the other half a photo of a juice that had 106,613 likes. Then the respondents had to indicate to what extent to what extent they would intend to buy the juice ("buyinginterest": a higher score means a higher buying intention). The question was whether the showing a juice with many likes leads to a higher buying intention than a juice with few likes.
