========

Suppose it is known that 0.002 of Dutch women have disease *D* has. There is a test to detect this disease. That test is not always reliable: in 0.04 of the cases in which the subject has the person has the disease, the test gives the result "no disease = negative result. In other words, 0.96 of them are discovered with a positive result. In other words, 0.96 of the people who do not have the disease get a negative result. Marja is told that she has a negative test result.

Set the events:

* *G* = No disease *D*.
* *N* = The negative test result.

Then what is the probability P(*G* and *N*)?
