Question
========
Below are the results of a single regression (Model 1) and multiple regression (Model 2). The dependent variable "**anti-immigration**" is attitude toward immigration, where the scale ranges from 1 (very positive attitude) to 5 (very negative attitude). "**Age**" is age in years and "**Education**" measures one's education level, where the scale runs from 1 (low education) to 8 (highly educated). The data is from the Dutch Voters Survey 2017.  
What percentage of the effect of age on Y is explained by taking differences in education level into account? (Round to 1 decimal place)Â
