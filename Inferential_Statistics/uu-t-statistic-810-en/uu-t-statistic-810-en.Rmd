Research has shown that losing even one nightâ€™s sleep can have a significant effect on performance of complex tasks such as problem solving (Linde & Bergstroem, 1992). To demonstrate this phenomenon, a random sample of 25 male and female college students was given a problem-solving task at noon on one day and again at noon on the following day. The students were not permitted any sleep between the two tests. The problem-solving ability was measured on a scale from 1 to 10.
