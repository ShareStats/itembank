Question
========
The analyses below were conducted on data from a sample of young adults between the ages of 20 and 40 who were surveyed via a questionnaire about their cultural preferences. The research questions are (1) To what extent the preference for cultural vacations (variable: CULVAC (scale 0-1): a higher score means the preference for cultural vacations is stronger) is caused by the social position of the parental environment (measured is parental education (variable: FAMEDUC (scale 0-7), ranging from primary education (0) to university (7)) a higher score means higher education) and (2) whether this relationship can be explained by one's own achieved education level (variable: EDUC (scale 0-6), ranging from lower vocational education (0) to university (6)) a higher score means a higher education).  
  
Below are the results of two regression analyses.

If this sample is one of 95% containing the population value then we can conclude from the 95% confidence interval of 'FAMEDUC' in **model 1 of the first regression analysis **conclude that under this assumption ....

Answerlist
----------
* The population value can also be 0, and that therefore there is insufficient evidence that there will be a positive effect of 'FAMEDUC' in the population
* The population value will not be 0, and therefore there is likely to be a positive effect of 'FAMEDUC' in the population
* The estimated b (.031) is part of the confidence interval, and That there is therefore likely to be a positive effect of 'FAMEDUC' in the population
* The t value 4.785 is outside the limits of the confidence interval lies, and that therefore there is likely to be a positive effect of 'FAMEDUC' in the population will be
