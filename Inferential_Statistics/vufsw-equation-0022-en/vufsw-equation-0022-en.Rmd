Question
========
On the formula sheet are these two formulas of a multiple regression of Y (see bottom of question).  
What is the difference between "*b*<sub>1</sub>" and<sub> </sub>"*β*<sub>1</sub>" in these formulas?

Answerlist
----------
* "*b*<sub>1</sub>" represents the full effect of X<sub>1</sub> on Y, and "*β*<sub>1</sub>" represents the partial effect of X<sub>1</sub> on Y.
* *b*<sub>1</sub>" represents the direct effect of X<sub>1</sub> on Y, and "*β*<sub>1</sub>" represents the indirect effect of X<sub>1</sub> on Y.
* *b*<sub>1</sub>" represents the observed effect of X<sub>1</sub> on Y in the sample, and "*β*<sub>1</sub>" represents the effect of X<sub>1</sub> on Y in the entire population.
* *b*<sub>1</sub>" represents the uncontrolled effect of X<sub>1</sub> on Y, and "*β*<sub>1</sub>" represents the effect of X<sub>1</sub> on Y after controlling for the effect of the other independent variables.
