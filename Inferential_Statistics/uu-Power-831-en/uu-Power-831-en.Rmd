Question
========
  
In the study by Fazio et al. (1981), researchers compare the difference in performance between two personality types (type A and type B) on two tasks (single and multiple). Subjects are randomly assigned to the two conditions. In the single condition, the subject is asked to tick off errors in a text. In the multiple condition, the subject is asked the same question but is regularly given a brief different task unannounced. A total of 10 minutes is spent in both conditions in detecting errors in the text. The number of errors found correct is the performance level. It was tested at $\alpha$ = 5%.

The hypotheses drawn up by the researchers say that there are no main effects and that there is an interaction effect. The hypothesis drawn up by Fazio et al. about the interaction reads: people with Type A personality are challenged by the multiple task and perform better because of it; on the other hand, people with Type B personality are distracted by the multiple task and perform worse.


Suppose that at a university someone wants to replicate the research of Fazio et al. but with greater power. Which of the following statements about this is correct, assuming other conditions remain the same?

I The power of a test increases as the sample size increases. II The power of a test becomes greater if the probability of error of the first kind is reduced.
