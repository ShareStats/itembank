Question
========
  
The scores in a sample of n = 12 have mean M = 5 and standard error sM = 1. A two-sided t-test with $\alpha$ = 5% results in a test statistic of t = 2.5. What are the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval, respectively?

  
Answerlist
----------
* The confidence interval is irrelevant because the t-test is not significant.
* Lower limit = 2.5, upper limit = 7.5.
* Lower limit = 2.821, upper limit = 7.179.
* Lower limit = 2.799, upper limit = 7.201.
