Question
========
A group of researchers are interested in perceived age discrimination and wants to know if perceived age discrimination is influenced by a person's age. The expectation is that both younger and older people experience more age discrimination than middle-aged people. They are analyzing data from the 2008/2009 *European Social Survey*, which consists of data from 28 countries.  
  
For a group of countries, they find the following observed relationship between X and Y in the figure below.  
Based on this figure, are these good data for a single linear regression analysis?

Answerlist
----------
* No, because this graph shows that the conditional standard deviation (s<sub>res</sub>) at certain ages is very different from 0 (especially in younger people).
* No, because this graph shows that people of certain ages are are less represented in this sample than people of other ages (especially middle-aged people are underrepresented).
* No, because this graph shows that there is no linear relationship between X and Y.
* We can't say that based on just this information; we can assess the assumptions in a regression analysis on the basis of this data.
