Question
========
A researcher doubts whether he would not be better off becoming an athlete after all, and if he chooses to do so, what sport would be best for him. To determine this for himself, he drew a sample from all professional athletes in the U.S. and determined what their average annual income was (in 10,000 dollars). In addition, he determined what sport [Football = 1, Basketball = 2, Baseball = 3] someone did, and whether it was a male [Gender = 0] or female [Gender = 1] athlete.

The researcher wants to know if [Income] differs between the types of athletes [Sports] taking into account their gender [Sex]. Perform a 2-way ANOVA. What is men's Estimated Marginal Mean (3 decimal places)?
