There are four averages a total of six possible differences between averages and therefore six confidence intervals. For comparison, the researcher also calculates comparison also calculates the ordinary 95% confidence intervals. Two of these ordinary 95% confidence intervals are (8, 12) and (16, 20). Now what are possibly Tukey 95% confidence intervals that correspond to the above two ordinary confidence intervals?
