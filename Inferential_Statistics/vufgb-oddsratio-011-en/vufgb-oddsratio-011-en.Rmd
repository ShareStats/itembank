Question
========
See the logistic regression results below. In one study (n = 50), programmers must solve a programming problem in one hour. The resulting data file contains the response variable "solved" (dummy, solved within an hour = 1) and the predictors "experience" (programming experience in months) and gender (dummy, male = 1).
