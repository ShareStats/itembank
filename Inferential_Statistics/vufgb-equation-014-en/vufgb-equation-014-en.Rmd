Question
========

A researcher estimates a multiple regression model with two quantitative explanatory variables and their interaction. The estimated equation is: $\hat{y} = 24.1+0.08x_{1}-1.09x_{2}-1.77x_{1}x_{2}$. What does the equation look like if we have $x_{2}$ keep constant at 1? 
Answerlist
----------
* $\hat{y} = 24.10+0.08x_{1}$
* $\hat{y} = 23.01+0.08x_{1}$
* $\hat{y} = 23.01-1.69x_{1}$
* $\hat{y} = 24.10-1.69x_{1}$
