Question
========
Suppose a researcher administered a questionnaire to 130 employees of a
large company to assess how they rate their manager. The scores are
between 1 (very negative) and 10 (very positive). He wants to find out
whether people with a permanent contract \[n=70\] assess their manager
differently from people with a temporary contract \[n=60\]. He therefore
calculates the 95% confidence interval of the difference between the
averages.  
  
Which formula should be used in this case?
