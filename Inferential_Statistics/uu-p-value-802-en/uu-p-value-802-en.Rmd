Question
========
  
For her bachelors thesis, a student researched the stress experienced by asylum seekers while they, residing in an asylum seekers' center, wait for a residence permit. Her focus was on parents of small children. A questionnaire was administered (with an interpreter present if necessary) and a stress score was determined for all the participants in this study. Is there a relationship between parents' age and their stress scores? Part of the SPSS output is below.
