Question
========
A researcher took a random sample of 50 men and 52 women and, among
other things, asked about the number of hours that respondents spend on
the internet per week. The null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub> is that there
is no difference between men and women; the alternative hypothesis
H<sub>a</sub> of the researcher is that the average number of hours per
week does differ between men and women. This is tested with alpha =
0.01. Below is (a part of) the results.  
  

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>mean difference</td>
<td>standard error of the mean difference</td>
<td>Degrees of freedom</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>0.535</td>
<td>0.954</td>
<td>100</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

  
Suppose the mean number of hours among the men in the sample would have
been much higher. Which quantity (or quantities) change as a result of
the higher average of men?

Answerlist
----------
* The *t*-value.
* The alpha
* The *t*-value and the alpha
* None of the above answers.

Solution
========





The alpha is a quantity you decide on for the testing. The *t* value can
be calculated with the mean difference divided by the standard error. If
the mean of the men is higher the mean difference will also be higher,
so the *t* value also higher.
