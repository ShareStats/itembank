Question
========
A researcher studies the effect of giving a lecture on scientific ethics to scientists. She also wants to know whether this effect differs between men and women. She asks a number of questions about this to 6 female and 6 male respondents at three times; before the lecture, shortly after the lecture and a few months after the lecture (3 measurements). She creates a scale from the responses for each measurement. What is the best method of analysis for her to use?

Answerlist
----------
* Mixed design ANOVA with one within and one between variable
* Mixed design ANOVA with two within and one between variable
* Repeated measures ANOVA with two within variables
* MANOVA with one within and one between variable

Solution
========

This analysis is a combination of a Repeated Measures design (3 measurements per subject) and a between groups design (men vs. women). So, this is a Mixed Design ANOVA with one within and one between variable.
