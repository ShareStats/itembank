Question
========
  
A researcher administered questionnaires to 25 randomly selected employees of a company. The questionnaires measure feelings of worry, stress level, and other social-emotional aspects, among others. The researcher wants to test whether the correlation between worry and stress is significant among $\alpha=.01$ and wants a $t$-test. TRUE is the minimum value of the correlation it must find so that the $t$-test will yield significant results?  
  
Answerlist
----------
* .505
* .487
* .396
* .462


Solution
========
When using a correlation table, we can look up the critical value. This involves a simple (Pearson) correlation, and a two-sided test. We should then look for at $df=n-2=25-2=23$ and at $\alpha=.01$. The correct critical value is then: $r=.505$
  


Answerlist
----------
* Correct
* Zoekand at $df=25$ delivers: $r=.487$
* Zoekand at $\alpha=.05$ delivers: $r=.396$
* Eenzijdige waarde delivers: $r=.462$
