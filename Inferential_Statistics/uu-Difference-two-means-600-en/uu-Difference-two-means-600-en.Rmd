If for two independent samples of 5 people each, the pooled variance equals 20, what is the value of the standard error of the difference between two sample averages? 
Answerlist
----------
* 2
* $\sqrt{5}$
* $\sqrt{8}$
* $\sqrt{10}$

Solution
========
$SE=\sqrt{\frac{s_p^2}{n_1}+\frac{s_p^2}{n_2}}=\sqrt{\frac{20}{5}+\frac{20}{5}}=\sqrt{8}$
$SE
