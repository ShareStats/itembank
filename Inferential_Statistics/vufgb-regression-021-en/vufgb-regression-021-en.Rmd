Question
========

An experimental investigation of the relationship between Y = achievement, S = dummy gender (girl=1) and G = dummy reward (well reward=1) yields the following regression equation: ${Y}’ = 20+6S–4G$. Hanneke is in the condition where there are rewards and she has a performance of 23. What is her predicted performance and how big is her residue $Y_{i}-{Y}'_{i}$?

----------
* Predicted performance: 22 ; residue: -1
* Predicted performance: 23 ; residue: -2
