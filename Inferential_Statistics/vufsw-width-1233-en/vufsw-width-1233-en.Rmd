confidence interval will......

Answerlist

* increase by a factor of 4.
* decrease by a factor of two.
* decrease by a factor of 4.

Solution
========





The answer: *increase by a factor of two *is **wrong**. It is true that
the factor is 2, but increasing the sample size decreases the width of
confidence intervals because it decreases the standard error. The
standard error for a population percentage has the square root of the
sample size in the denominator.  
  
The answer: *increase by a factor of 4* is **wrong**. Increasing the
sample size decreases the width of confidence intervals because it
decreases the standard error. Also, the standard error for a population
percentage has the square root of the sample size in the denominator.
Hence, increasing the sample size by a factor of 4 (i.e., multiplying it
by 4) is equivalent to multiplying the standard error by 1/2.  
  
The answer: *decrease by a factor of two* is **correct**. The standard
error for a population percentage has the square root of the sample size
in the denominator. Hence, increasing the sample size by a factor of 4
(i.e., multiplying it by 4) is equivalent to multiplying the standard
error by 1/2. Hence, the interval will be half as wide.  
  
The answer: *decrease by a factor of 4* is **wrong**. It is true that it
decreases but not by a factor of 4. The standard error for a population
percentage has the square root of the sample size in the denominator.
Hence, increasing the sample size by a factor of 4 (i.e., multiplying it
by 4) is equivalent to multiplying the standard error by 1/2. Hence, the
interval will be half as wide.
