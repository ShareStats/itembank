Question
========
  
A study of the relationship between location of deployment (Iraq or Afghanistan) and depression of soldiers primarily examines only whether soldiers became depressed, yes or no. A $\chi^2$-test is performed and the variables were found, in a sample of 60 soldiers, not to be independent: $\chi^2(1, n = 60) = 5.88$, $p = .015$. What is the value of the effect size that should be reported here? 
Answerlist
----------
* $0.015$
* $0.098$
* $0.313$
* This cannot be determined because the cross table is not given.

Solution
========
  
Location is a dichotomous variable (Iraq/Afghanistan), as is depression (yes/no). To calculate the effect size in this case, the phi coefficient can be calculated:

$\phi= \sqrt{\frac{\chi^2}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac {5.88}{60}} =0.313$
 
 


Answerlist
----------
* $.015$ is $p$-value and not the effect size.
* Thist answer ($.098$) forgot to root.
* $\phi= \sqrt{\frac{\chi^2}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac {5.88}{60}} =0.313$
* This can indeed be determined. Location is a dichotomous variable (Iraq/Afghanistan), as is depression (yes/no). To calculate the effect size in this case, the phi coefficient can be calculated.
