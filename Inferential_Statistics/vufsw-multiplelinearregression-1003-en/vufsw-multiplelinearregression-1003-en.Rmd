Question
========
  
Recent research has shown that lecturers are among the most stressed
workers. A researcher wanted to know exactly what it was about being a
lecturer that created this stress and subsequent burnout. She recruited
75 lecturers and administered several questionnaires that measured:
** Burnout ** (high score = burnt out), ** Perceived Control ** (high
score = low perceived control ), ** Coping Ability ** (high score = low
ability to cope with stress), **Stress from Teaching** (high score =
teaching creates a lot of stress for the person), **Stress from
Research** (high score = research creates a lot of stress for the
person), and **Stress from Providing Pastoral Care** (high score =
providing pastoral care creates a lot of stress for the person). The
outcome of interest was burnout, and Cooper’s (1988) model of stress
indicates that perceived control and coping style are important
predictors of this variable. The remaining predictors were measured to
see the unique contribution of different aspects of a lecturer’s work
tot heir burnout.  
  
How would you interpret the beta value for ‘perceived control’ in
regression 3?

Answerlist
----------
* As perceived control increases by one standard deviation, burnout
  increases by 0.541 standard deviations controlling for the other
  variables. Therefore, the lower perceived control is the lower burnout
  becomes. The effect is statistically significant.
* As perceived control increases by one unit, burnout increases by 0.541
  units controlling for the other variables. Therefore, the higher
  perceived control is, the higher the burnout becomes. The effect is
  statistically significant.
* As perceived control increases by one standard deviation, burnout
  increases by 0.541 units controlling for the other variables. Therefore,
  the higher the perceived control is, the higher burnout becomes. The
  effect is statistically significant.
* As perceived control increases by one standard deviation, burnout
  increases by 0.541 standard deviations controlling for the other
  variables. Therefore, the lower the perceived control is, the higher
  burnout becomes. The effect is statistically significant.

Solution
========





If X increases with 1 standard deviation then Y increases with beta
standard deviations controlling for the other variables. This is the
definition of the interpretation of a standardized coefficient (beta) in
a regression. Take also into account that the coefficient is positive
and the fact that high values of perceived control indicate a low
ability to cope with stress.
