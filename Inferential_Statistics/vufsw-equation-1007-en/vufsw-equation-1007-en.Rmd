Question
========
A researcher relates the number of hours spent practising and the
ability to successfully execute a specific skill (e.g. diving, arm stand
dive, high board dive) with the use of a linear regression model: the
more you practise, the better the performance of the dive.  
  
Calculate the predicted score in a diving competition if they have
amassed 250 hours of training. Assume that the* slope of hours of
training =* .1016 on diving performance and the *constant* = 22.5 in the
regression equation. *Use only one decimal!*


Solution
========





The regression equation is: Diving score = 22.5 + 0.1016\*hours
training  
 If you replace hours with 250: (diving score = 22.5 + 0.1016 \* 250),
you will reach the outcome 47.9
