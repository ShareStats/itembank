Question
========
A researcher runs a multiple regression to determine which factors
affect how much people **watch TV** (Y). The data come from the
*European Social Survey* of 2014. The questionnaire is administered to a
random sample of residents of the Netherlands 18 years old or older
(N=1362). The dependent variable Y is measured with a question with
answer options varying from 1 (“less than half an hour per day”) to 7
(“more than 3 hours per day”). **Education** (Educyrs) is measured in
the number of years that the respondent has followed education. The
scores in this variable vary from 0 to 28 years. The table below
presents the results of this regression.

Fill in the blanks:  
  
If an individual that has followed the 10 years in education is compared
with someone that has followed 11 years of education, we expect a lower
score in watching TV by **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \[Text 1\]**.  
  
If we run a two-sided test with a significance level of 5% (α = 0.05),
we can conclude that the effect of the number of years of education is
significant, because the P-value equals **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
\[Text 2\].**
