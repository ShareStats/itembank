Question
========

Calculate the number of degrees of freedom associated with the Interaction Effect AB in a factorial ANOVA with 3 X 3 design. 
Answerlist
----------
* 2
* 3
* 4
* 9

Solution
========

$df = (g-1) \times (h-1) = (3-1) \times (3-1) = 2 \times 2 = 4$.

If you write out ANOVA model as a regression model with dummy variables you get two dummy variables for Factor 1 and two dummy variables for Factor 2. That yields in the regression model $2 \times 2 = 4$ interaction terms. Difference in parameters between model with and without interaction is then 4.

This is the reasoning if you conceive of the *F* test as a model comparison test!
