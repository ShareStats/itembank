Question
========
  
Isa wishes to compare the prices of apartments in two neighboring towns using a significance level of 5%. She takes a random sample of 12 apartments in town A and calculates the average price of these apartments (M = 850, SD = 85). She repeats this for 15 apartments in town B (M = 825, SD = 75). Let μA represent the true average price of apartments in town A and μB the average price in town B.

What would be the hypotheses for this problem?
  
Answerlist
----------
* H0: μA = μB versus HR: μA < μB 
* H0: μA = μB versus HR: μA > μB 
* H0: μA = μB versus HR: μA ≠ μB 
* This cannot be determined without further information.
