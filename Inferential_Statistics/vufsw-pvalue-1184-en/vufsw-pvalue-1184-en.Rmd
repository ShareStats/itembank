We run a hypothesis testing for a proportion with the following null and
alternative hypothesis:  
  
H<sub>0</sub>: *p* = 0.50  
H<sub>a</sub>: *p *&gt; 0.50  
  
The observed z-score is -1.88. The corresponding P-value (see Table A:
*Standard Normal Cumulative Probabilities*) is 3.01% (actually 0.0301).
This means that there is a 3.01% probability that ...
