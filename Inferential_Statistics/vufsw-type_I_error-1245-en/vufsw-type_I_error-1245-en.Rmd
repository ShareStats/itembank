Solution
========





We are going to make a type I error. The probability of this error is
5%. A **type I error** is the rejection of a true [null
hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis) (also known
as a "false positive" finding), while a **type II error** is failing to
reject a false null hypothesis (also known as a "false negative"
finding).<sup>[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors#cite_note-1)</sup>
More simply stated, a type I error is to falsely infer the existence of
something that is not there (confirming to common belief with false
information), while a type II error is to falsely infer the absence of
something present (going against the common belief with false
information).
