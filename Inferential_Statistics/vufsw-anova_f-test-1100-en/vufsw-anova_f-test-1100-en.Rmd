Question
========
A psychologist runs a regression with empathy as a dependent variable
(Y) and gender as the independent variable (X). She finds an F-statistic
of 83.1, with p &lt; 0.001 (see the ANOVA table below). What does this
mean?

Answerlist
----------
* The association between gender and empathy is positive and statistically
  significant.
* The regression model with gender does significantly better in explaining
  the variance in empathy than a model without explanatory variables.
* The mean of empathy differs significantly from the mean of gender.
* The Regression Sum of Squares is positive and statistically significant.

Solution
========





The F-statistic is a measure of predictive power, and depends on the
mean square for regression and the mean square error. The F-statistic is
significant if the model does better in explaining the variance of the
dependent variable than a model without any explanatory variables.
