Question
========
  
In a study of the effect of a number of different teaching formats in academic education on learning achievement, they compared instructional lectures with smaller-scale work groups. In an experiment with randomly drawn groups of students, they found the following 95% confidence interval [ -0.07, 2.62] for the difference in average learning achievement between the study group students and the lecture group students.

The alternative hypothesis is that the learning performance of students who were taught in a study group differs from that of students in instructional lectures. Should one consider these at $\alpha$ = 5% accept?
