Question
========
30 employees of a multinational filled out a questionnaire twice, which,
among other things, recorded how much time (measured in number of
minutes per week) employees spend on various activities, such as
attending meetings and answering e-mails. The first measurement took
place a month prior to an 'effective meeting' course, and the second
measurement two months after the end of this course. A researcher
expects that the course has had an effect and employees spend less time
on meetings after the course. Suppose the results below were found. The
hypothesis is tested with a significance level of 5% (alpha = 0.05).  
  

<table class="tvcss_2 tvcss_3">
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td class="tvcss_4">N</td>
<td class="tvcss_5">mean time (measurement 1)</td>
<td class="tvcss_6"> mean time  (measurement 2)</td>
<td class="tvcss_7">mean difference  </td>
<td class="tvcss_8">standard error (se) of the mean difference      
  </td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td class="tvcss_4">30</td>
<td class="tvcss_5">56.2 minutes per week</td>
<td class="tvcss_6">51.9 minutes per week    </td>
<td class="tvcss_7">4.3</td>
<td class="tvcss_8">2.2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

  
Is the null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub> rejected?

Answerlist
----------
* Yes, because: the absolute observed t-value &gt; the critical t-value.
* No, because : the absolute observed t-value &gt; the critical t-value.
* Yes, because: the absolute observed t-value &lt; the critical t-value.
* No, because : the absolute observed t-value &lt; the critical t-value.

Solution
========





The t value is calculated by t = (mean1  -mean2) / se = 1.95.  
  
In table B, critical value; df = 29; alpha = 0.05; one sided, thus t =
1.70.  
  
Thus observed t value &gt; critical t value.

Answerlist
----------
* True
* False
* False
* False
