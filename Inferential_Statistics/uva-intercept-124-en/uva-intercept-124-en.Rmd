Question
========

A regression is done with two independent variables *x*~1~ and *x*~2~ which together should explain the dependent variable *y*. To represent the regression in a figure, for some values of *x*~2~ the regression with only x1 is recalculated over and over again and put into the figure. In this figure there are two such separate regression lines with the values for *x*~2~ of 2 and 5: What assumption of multiple regression for testing for coefficients is here probably being violated here?

Answerlist
----------

* There is a linear relationship between y and each of the independent variables.
