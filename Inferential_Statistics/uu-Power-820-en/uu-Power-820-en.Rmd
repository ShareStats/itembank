Question
========
  
A teacher wants to know if the current group of first-year students is performing better than last year's freshmen. He does this by comparing the average exam scores. Last year that average was 6.3. A sample of 61 students is now drawn from the current year. The instructor feels that there will be an improvement if at least an average exam grade of 6.8 is achieved. The distribution in the population is unchanged, viz. $\sigma$ = 1.7.

What is the power of this key at $\alpha$ = .05?
