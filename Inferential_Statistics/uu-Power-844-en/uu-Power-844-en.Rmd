Question
========
  
Children aged 8 to 12 years watch an average of 2 hours of TV per day with a standard deviation of σ = 2. Researchers expect ADHD children of the same age to watch TV longer. To test this hypothesis, researchers draw a random sample of 36 ADHD children and conduct a one-sample z test with $\alpha$ = 5%. What is the power of this test if the population of ADHD children watches an average of 3 hours of TV per day? (Assume that $\sigma$ =2 also in the ADHD population).
