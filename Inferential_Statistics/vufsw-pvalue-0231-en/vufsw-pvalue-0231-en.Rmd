Question
========
What are we testing when we look at the p-value of a b-coefficient in a linear regression model?

Answerlist
----------
* Assuming that the **zero hypothesis** (H<sub>0</sub>) is TRUE in the **population**, how (un)probable is it to obtain this observed t value (or an even more extreme t value)? If it is highly unlikely, then we reject the null hypothesis.

* Assuming that the **alternative** hypothesis (H<sub>a</sub>) is true is true in the **population**, how (un)likely is it to have this observed t-value (or an even more extreme t-value)? If it is very unlikely, then we reject the null hypothesis.
