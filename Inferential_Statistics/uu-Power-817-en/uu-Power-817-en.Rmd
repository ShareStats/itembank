Question
========
  
A teacher wants to know whether the current group of first-year students is performing better than last year's freshmen. She does this by comparing the average assignment grade in a randomly drawn sample of current first-year students to the average assignment grade of all students who were first-year students last year (here, the average assignment grade is $\sigma$ = 0.8). What is the smallest sample size where the teacher with a power of at least 85% and a $\alpha$ of 1% can note an improvement of 0.2 over last year?
