========
We are interested in evaluating the effect of a natural product on reducing blood pressure.  This is done by comparing the mean reduction in blood pressure of a treatment (natural product) group and a placebo group using a two-sample t test.  The standard deviations are approximately the same, so the researchers will use an independent samples t test, and based on previous work the researchers are able to specify a common sample standard deviation.  The researchers have specified $\mu_{1}$ – $\mu_{2}$ = 7 as an alternative they would like to be able to detect with a significance level of 1%.  Sample sizes of 50 in each group are selected and found to have a power of 80%.  If the researchers now decide they are interested in the alternative $\mu_{1}$ – $\mu_{2}$ = 5 instead, how would the power of the study for this alternative compare to the previous one?

Answerlist
----------
* It would be greater than 80%.
* It would be less than 80%.
* It could be either less than or greater than 80%, depending on whether the natural product is effective.
* It could be either less than or greater than 80%, depending on the standard deviation.
