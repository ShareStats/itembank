Question
========

The regression equation representing the relationship between *y* (postmeasurement) on the one hand and sex (*z* = 1 for women; *z* = 0 for men) and *x* (premeasurement) on the other hand is $\hat{y} = 4+0.45x+0.9z$. The mean premeasurement is 9 for women and 7 for men. The overall premeasurement mean is 8.

For women, determine the adjusted mean ("adjusted mean") on the post-measurement.
