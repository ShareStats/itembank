Question
========
  
Research is conducted on the influence of background noise on text comprehension and understanding among 6 VWO students. It is decided to conduct an experiment. Half of the students are allowed to read through the text once beforehand (Variable practiced = 1) and the other half of the students see the text for the first time during the experiment (Variable practiced = 0). Students are divided equally between two noise conditions (a little vs. a lot). Part of the SPSS output is shown below.
