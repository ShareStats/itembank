Question
========

A company *A* owns three factories, namely *A*~1~, *A*~2~ and *A*~3~, TRUE where razors of the same type are made. The probability of a defective device at *A*~1~, *A*~2~ and *A*~3~ is, respectively: 0.1; 0.06 and 0.05. During a given period, all three factories in aggregate make 10,000 shavers of which 2000 are made by *A*~1~, 5000 by *A*~2~ and 3000 by *A*~3~. From the total production an inspector randomly chooses a shaver and the chosen razor turns out to be defective. What is the probability P(*A*~1~|*D*) that it came from factory *A*~1~?
