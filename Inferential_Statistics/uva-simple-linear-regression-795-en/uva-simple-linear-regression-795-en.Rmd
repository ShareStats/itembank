Question
========

Given is the table of correlations for three predictors *x*~1~, *x*~2~ and *x*~3~:

  -------- -------- -------- -------- *x*~1~ *x*~2~ *x*~3~ *x*~1~ \- *x*~2~ 0.72 \- *x*~3~ 0.01 0.03 \- -------- -------- -------- --------

The regression equation for the dependent variable *y* with only *x*~1~ and *x*~2~ is $\hat{y} = 8.75 + 3.51x_{1} + 4.32x_{2}$
Now suppose the model is calculated with *x*~3~ added. Then the coefficient
