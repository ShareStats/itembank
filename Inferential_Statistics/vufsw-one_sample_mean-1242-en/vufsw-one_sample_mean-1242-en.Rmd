Question
========
Suppose a teacher wants to test whether the average number of days that
students spend a week on statistics is higher than 3 days.  
Which type of test would he best use?

Answerlist
----------
* One-sample t-test
* Independent t-test
* Chi-square test
* Simple regression

Solution
========





It is a one sample t test, because **The **One Sample t Test** is
commonly used to **test **the following:**  

1.  Statistical difference between a **sample** mean and a known or
    hypothesized value of the mean in the population.
2.  Statistical difference between the **sample** mean and the
    **sample** midpoint of the **test** variable.

The **independent t-test**, is an inferential statistical **test** that
determines whether there is a statistically significant difference
between the means in two unrelated groups.  
  
 **Use** the **chi**-**square test** for independence to determine
whether there is a significant relationship between two categorical
variables.  
  
Use a simple regression
[](http://statisticsbyjim.com/glossary/regression-analysis/)to describe
the relationships between an independent variable and a dependent
variable.
