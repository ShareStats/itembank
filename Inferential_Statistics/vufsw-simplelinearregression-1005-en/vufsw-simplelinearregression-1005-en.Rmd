Answerlist
----------
* The average depression when the variable news equals its mean
* The average depression is 7.241 when news exposure increases by 1 unit.
* As news exposure increases by 1 minute, depression increases by 7.241
  units.
* The average depression is 7.241 when news exposure is zero

Solution
========





This is the definition of the interpretation of the constant. The
constant represents the average value of the dependent variable Y when
all the independent variables equal zero.
