Question
========
One survey included the following question on the extent to which a person has confidence in the police. This variable is called "**Police**".  
The researcher expects that people with a migration background have less trust the police than people without a migration background and wants a single regression analysis to find out if this is so. She uses the dummy variable "**Migration background" **as** **independent variable and tests one-way with α = 0.05 (alpha =5%).  
  
What is the appropriate **zero hypothesis** and **alternative hypothesis** that belongs to this one-sided testing?
