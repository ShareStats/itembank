Question
========
VU medical school is conducting a study on the effectiveness of a drug that should lead to lower blood pressure. For this purpose, the blood pressure *before* the use of the drug is compared with the blood pressure *after* the drug has been used for three weeks by the subjects studied.  
  
Below are the results.  
  
The researcher's one-sided hypothesis is that mean blood pressure decreased significantly. She uses a significance level of 5% (Î± = .05).  
  
What is the conclusion?

Answerlist
----------
* We find empirical evidence for the proposition that the drug had a lowering effect, because the observed absolute t value is **greater** than the critical t-value.
* We find empirical evidence for the proposition that the drug had a lowering effect, because the observed absolute t value is **smaller** than the critical t-value.
* We find **no** empirical evidence for the proposition that the drug had had a lowering effect, because the observed absolute t value is **greater** than the critical t value.
* We find **no** empirical evidence for the proposition that the drug had had a lowering effect, because the observed absolute t-value is **smaller**than the critical t-value.
