Question
========
In the regression Y = b<sub>0</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>X<sub>1 </sub>+ b<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub>, what is the interpretation of b<sub>2</sub> ?

Answerlist
----------
* The linear relation between X<sub>2</sub>and Y
* The linear relation between X<sub>2 </sub>and Y, given X<sub>1</sub>
* The linear relationship between X<sub>2</sub> and X<sub>1</sub>, given Y
* The variance of Y explained by X<sub>2 </sub>

Solution
========

The regression coefficients measure partial relationships between the Xs and the Y and unexplained variance. The measure of explained variance is the R<sup>2</sup>
