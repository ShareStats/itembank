Question
========
In an experiment, participants were randomly divided into two groups (group variable: ERROR_APPROACH) who had to perform a task. The two groups were instructed differently beforehand: error prevention (" you are not allowed to make mistakes" ) and error management (" you are allowed to make mistakes make mistakes, you learn from them"). Below is a series of AN(C)OVA analyses TRUE examined whether error-approach affects how well the task was performed (PERFORMANCE). SELFCONTROL (degree of self-discipline, measured prior to the experiment) is a covariate in these analyses a covariate.
