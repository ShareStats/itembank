Question
========
What is the significance test for a b-coefficient (t-test) testing?

Answerlist
----------
* It tests the null hypothesis that, in the population, the coefficient is
  zero against the alternative hypothesis that the coefficient in the
  population is **not **zero
* It tests the null hypothesis that, in the population, the coefficient
  equals the same value as the one found for the sample against the
  alternative hypothesis that the coefficient in the population does
  **not** equal the same value as the one found for the sample
* It tests the null hypothesis that the coefficient is **not **zero in the
  population against the alternative hypothesis that the coefficient in
  the population is zero
* It tests whether the P-value of the coefficient equals 0.05

Solution
========





The significance test for the b-coefficient tests the following:  
  
*H*<sub>*0*</sub> : *b* = 0  
*H*<sub>*a*</sub> : *b* ≠ 0
