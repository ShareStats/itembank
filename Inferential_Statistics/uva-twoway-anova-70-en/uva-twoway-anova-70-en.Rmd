Question
========

A one-way ANOVA (one factor) with three groups is performed. The assumptions are checked: the distribution at each group is normal and the variances within each group are equal. Furthermore, the subjects randomly assigned to one of the three groups. A a *follow up* test is done to examine which of the three groups are differences. The confidence interval of Fisher. This uses the *Mean Square within* (MS within/Error). This is the average of the three variances calculated within each group is calculated. This method is allowed because (a) the distribution of each group is normal and (b) the variances within each group are equal.
