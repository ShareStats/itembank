Question
========
A psychologist was interested in gauging the success of a mood
manipulation during one of her experiments. She had three groups of
participants who underwent different types of mood induction: disgust
mood induction, negative mood induction and positive mood induction.  
  
After the mood induction, participants were asked to endorse nine
statements relating to their mood (on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 =
disagree to 5 = agree):  
(1) When you're smiling the whole world smiles with you,  
(2) I love the pretty flowers,  
(3) I could never touch a dead body,  
(4) I would never eat cat food,  
(5) If someone served me monkey brain soup I would vomit,  
(6) I feel fed up, (7) Bodily fluids are nasty,  
(8) I could not drink from a glass that I'd used to catch a spider,  
(9) I am a worthless piece of scum.  
  
Part of the output is below. Which of the following statements best
summarizes the output?
