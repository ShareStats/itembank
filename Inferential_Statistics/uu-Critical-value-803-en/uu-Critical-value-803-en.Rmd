========
  
One study shows that where a passenger sits on the bus (in the front, middle, or back) has an effect on the likelihood of someone getting car sickness (Griffin & Turner, 1999). An experiment is being conducted in the Netherlands to see if the results apply here as well. The table below shows the results of the experiment.
