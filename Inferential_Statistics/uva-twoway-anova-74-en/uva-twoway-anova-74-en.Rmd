Question
========

The null hypothesis for the interaction of an ANOVA with two factors A and B with two level averages each (A1, A2 and B1, B2), states that at level A1 the difference in averages between B1 and B2 is equal to the difference in averages between B1 and B2 at A2. This means that I. the differences between the levels of B1 and B2 are the same at A1 and at A2. II. the averages at B1 and B2 are the same at A1 as at A2.
