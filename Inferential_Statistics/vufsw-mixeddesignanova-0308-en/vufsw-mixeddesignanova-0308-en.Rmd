Question
========
We analyse whether the performance of pupils differs between 3 subjects:
literature, essay writing and mathematics (they are in this order in the
data set). In addition, we investigate whether any differences between
the 3 subjects vary between male and female students.   
Therefore, we use a Mixed Design ANOVA. The output of this analysis is
shown below.  
 "Female" is coded as 0: male, 1: female.  
Which F-value indicates whether there is sufficient evidence for
differences in the population between male and female pupils in their
performance (without taking into account differences between the 3
subjects)? *Round to 3 decimal places*
