Question
========
A researcher is interested in the difference in study results between
students who are optimistic versus students who are pessimistic. Suppose
that the researcher does **not** find a significant difference between
the two groups of students, while in the population a difference
actually exists.  
  
What is going on?

Answerlist
----------
* A Type I error is made.
* A Type II error is made.
* The null hypothesis has rightly been rejected.
* The null hypothesis is rightly assumed.

Solution
========





A type II error is made.  
In statistical hypothesis testing, a type I error is the rejection of a
true null hypothesis (also known as a "false positive" finding), while a
type II error is failing to reject a false null hypothesis (also known
as a "false negative" finding).  
More simply stated, a type I error is to falsely infer the existence of
something that is not there, while a type II error is to falsely infer
the absence of something that is present.
