Question
========
A researcher examines the extent to which a country's level of prosperity can explain a country's strength of religiosity. "**Wealth**" (X) of a country is measured by the Human Development Index (HDI), and "**Religiosity**" (Y) was measured using a scale from 0 (not religious) to 10 (very religious). A regression analysis of data from 46 countries (n=46) yields the following model: Å¶ = 8.58 - 1.76x.  
  
Canada has an HDI score of 0.94. The observed religiosity score for this country was 8.00. What is the **residue** of this country (round this number to 2 decimal places). And what does this number mean?

Answerlist
----------
* 1,07. The observed religiosity for Canada is 1.07 higher than the predicted score.
