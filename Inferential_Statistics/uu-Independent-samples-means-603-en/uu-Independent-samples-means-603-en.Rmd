Solution
========
  
1. $H_0: \mu_m = \mu_f$ and $H_{A}: \mu_m > \mu_f$
2. $\alpha=.05$, $df_{Total} = 51+51-2=100$, cut-off $=1.660$
4. $t= \frac {227.4-222}{\sqrt {9 (1/51 + 1/51)} } = 9.09$ 
5. We can reject $H_0$ and conclude that the average number of friends for male students is higher than for female students.
