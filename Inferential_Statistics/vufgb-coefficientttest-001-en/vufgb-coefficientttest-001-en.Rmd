Question
========
We discuss a linear regression analysis with two predictors. The number of subjects is 12. Calculate the number of degrees of freedom and determine the critical *t* value needed to establish a 95% confidence interval for a regression coefficient in this model.

Answerlist
----------
* *df* = 9; *t* = 2.262.
* *df* = 9; *t* = 1.833.
* *df* = 10; *t* = 2.228.
* *df* = 10; *t* = 1.812.
