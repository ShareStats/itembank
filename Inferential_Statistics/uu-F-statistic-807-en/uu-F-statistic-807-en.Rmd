Question
========
  
A sample of 235 students in the Faculty of Social Sciences at Utrecht University are given a questionnaire to complete about feelings. One of the questions read, "What do you think about your own height?" The response categories were: too short, about right, too tall. A total score was calculated for all students; it measures students' self-esteem. The results of the self-esteem scores are compared between the three height-sensitive groups and between boys and girls. The F-ratio for the interaction effect between height-feelings and gender is 4.98 with a p-value of 0.008.

How many degrees of freedom belong to the F-ratio measuring the interaction effect?
