Question
========
A survey among Dutch employees showed that the group of employees with
burn-out complaints (n = 16) were on average for 189 days absent, with a
standard deviation of 38 days. A critical student of Organizational
Sciences asserts that the average number of days missed due to absence
of all Dutch employees is actually 200.  
  
Calculate the observed t-value associated with the testing of this
hypothesis.

* -1.16
* -4.63
* -7.14
* -2.33

You can calculate this : (189-200)/9,5=-1,16  
  
The 9,5 is calculated by s/√n=38/4=9,5
