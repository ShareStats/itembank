Question
========
Field claims that there has been an increase in muscle injuries as a due to playing Nintendo's Wii computer game. A researcher expects that people who play sports are less affected by this suffer from this because they are already accustomed to exercise. For those non-athletes, she expects that a warm-up prior to a Wii session will help prevent these injuries.  
  
To investigate this, she selects 120 athletes and 120 non-athletes ('athlete' - yes(1)/no(0)). Within each of the two groups, the participants were then randomly assigned to two groups: half had to do a 5-minute stretching (warm-up), and the other half did not (variable 'stretch' - yes(1)/no(0)). In all participants, after after the 4-hour Wii session, pain symptoms were measured on a scale of 1-10 ('injury'; 0 = no pain, 10 = strong pain).  
  
Below are the results of the analysis.

Based on the design of this study, and without considering considering whether all assumptions have been met, draw conclusions about the causal relationship between being an athlete (yes/no) and the pain symptoms?

Answerlist
----------
* No, this study did not control for possible confounding variables that may confound the relationship between sports (yes/no) and pain symptoms
* No, this study did not control for possible mediating variables that may confound the relationship between sports (yes/no) and pain symptoms may confound.
* No, this study did not control for possible confounding as well as mediating variables that may distort the relationship between sports (yes/no) and pain.
* Yes, the statistically found relationship between sports (yes/no) and pain pain in this study can be interpreted causally
