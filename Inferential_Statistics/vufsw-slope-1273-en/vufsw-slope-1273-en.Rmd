* This is the significance level 'alpha' and it typically takes the value
  0.05.
* This is the slope and takes the value 0 when X<sub>1 </sub>has no effect
  on Y.
* This is the slope and represents the predicted Y if X<sub>1 </sub>
  equals 0.
* This is the slope and represents the predicted change in Y  if
