Question
========
  
An educationalist wants to investigate whether prior knowledge of body parts (PREBODY) depends on residential environment (site) and general development (PEABODY). For residential environment, four categories are distinguished:

Site 1 = city advantaged Site 2 = suburb Site 3 = city disadvantaged Site 4 = village

Data from the Sesame Street survey was used. The output of the analysis (parameter estimates) is given.

Answerlist
----------
* If PEABODY rises one point then the predicted score on PREBODY changes 11.9 points.
* The difference between the city favored category and the intercept of the reference category is 11.9 points.
* The average prediction error for the four categories of the variable SITE is equal to 11.9 points.
