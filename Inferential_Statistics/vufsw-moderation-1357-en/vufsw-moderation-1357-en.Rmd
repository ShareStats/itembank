Question
========
REGRESSION ANALYSIS Field describes a study on the growing interest in cosmetic surgical treatments. He collected data on the quality of life among a sample of respondents, some of whom part of whom had undergone cosmetic surgery and part of whom were still on the waiting list for it (variable: surgery: 0 = waiting list, 1 = cosmetic surgery). He measured the quality of life at registration for the cosmetic surgery, the "baseline" quality of life (variable: Base_Qol, scale 0-1, a higher score means higher quality of quality of life) and after a while, after the surgery had taken place for those who underwent the surgery immediately, but also at the same time for the group who were still on the waiting list (variable: Post\_Qol, scale 0-100, a higher score means a higher quality of life).  
Below are the results of a regression analysis with the post-measurement of quality of life as the dependent variable (Post_Qol), and in which having or not having undergone the cosmetic surgery (Surgery) and the "baseline" quality of life (Base_Qol) in the model are included. In model 2, in addition, the interaction between 'surgery' and 'baseline' quality of life were added to the model (Base_Qol_surgery).
