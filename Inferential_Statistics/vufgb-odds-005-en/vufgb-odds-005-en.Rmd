Question
========

See logistic regression results below. In a survey (n=150), programmers must solve a programming problem in one hour. The resulting data file contains the response variable "solved" (dummy, solved within an hour=1) and the predictors "experience" (programming experience in months) and gender (dummy, male=1).

At how many months of experience is the probability of a male programmer solving the problem 0.50?
