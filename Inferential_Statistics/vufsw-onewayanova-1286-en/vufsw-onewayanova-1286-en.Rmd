Question
========
In a study by Communication Studies students (Van Dun, Emanuels, Visser and De Wilde, 2011), respondents were presented with a picture of a girl who was dressed preppy, bohemian or cool (variable: subculture,1 preppy; 2 bohemian; 3 cool ('cool')). Respondents, randomly assigned to the three conditions, had to rate the popularity of the girl. The dependent variable is popularity in terms of 'social preference ' with items such as "With this girl .... "I would like to hang out with," and .... "would I want to be friends with" (variable: sp, scale 1-5, a higher score means the girl is more popular). The hypothesis is that clothing style leads to different ratings of the girl's popularity. Below are some results of an ANOVA.
