Question
========
In an experiment, participants were randomly divided into two groups
(group variable: ERROR\_APPROACH) that had to perform a task. The two
groups were instructed differently beforehand: error prevention ("you
are not allowed to make mistakes") and error management ("you are
allowed to make mistakes, you learn from them"). Below is a series of
AN(C)OVA analyses that examined whether the 'error-approach' influenced
how well the task was performed (PERFORMANCE). SELFCONTROL (degree of
self-discipline, measured prior to the experiment) is a covariate in
these analyses.

See additional analyses. Taking into account differences in self-control
between the two groups, how large are the estimated differences between
the 'error prevention' group and the 'error management' group?
