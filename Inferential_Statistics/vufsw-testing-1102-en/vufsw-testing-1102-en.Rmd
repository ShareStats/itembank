Question
========
22 randomly selected German journalists (group 1) and 20 randomly chosen Argentine journalists (group 2) were asked to rate the quality of the German team. The response scale ranges from 0 (very bad) to 10 (very good). The (fictitious) results show that the German group gives an average of 8.3 and the Argentine group gives an average of a 7.9. One researcher wants to find out whether the ratings are significantly different between the two groups. He calculates the 95% confidence interval of the difference in averages, µ<sub>1</sub>- µ<sub>2</sub>. This interval turns out to be (0.15; 0.65).  
  
The researcher concludes that the ratings of the two groups are significantly different from each other. From what can this be inferred?

Answerlist
----------
* The number 0.00 is outside the interval.
* The critical t value in a two-sided test with α = 0.05 and *df* = 40 is 2.02. This number lies outside the interval.
* The number 0.05 is outside the interval.
* The number 0.95 is outside the interval.
