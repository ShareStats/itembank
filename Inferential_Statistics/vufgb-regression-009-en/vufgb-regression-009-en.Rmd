Question
========

An experimental research study evaluating the association between Y = performance, S = dummy variable Sex (girl=1) and G = dummy variable Reward (reward =1) results in the following regression equation:  

$Y’ = 18+4S–2G$. 

Amelie is assigned the reward condition and has a performance of 22.

What is her predicted performance and what is her residual $Y_{i}-Y'_{i}$?
