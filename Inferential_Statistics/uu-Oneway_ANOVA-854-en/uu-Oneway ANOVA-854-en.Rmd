Question
========
Four education science students conduct a study for the bachelor's thesis on the effects of concept mapping on learning performance of psychology students (N = 86). The study distinguishes three conditions:

1. Pure: Students receiving instruction in concept mapping. 2. Supportive: Students receiving instruction in creating the concept map, with part of the concept map already given. 3. Control: Students who do not receive instruction in creating the concept map.

Four weeks after the psychology students read the chapter, they take a knowledge test on the material from the chapter (ten questions where each correct answer earns 1 point). Students in the pure and support condition are expected to score higher on average on the knowledge test than students in the control condition.

The education science students analyze the data with a one-way ANOVA. They note the following data from this in their report:

F(2, 83) = 17.90, p < .001, $\eta^2$ = 0.13.

Which of the following statements is correct based on the reported test result ($\alpha$ = 5%)?

Answerlist
----------
* The means of pure and support condition are significantly higher than the mean control condition.
* The effect of condition is significant but not relevant (less than 5% explained variance).
* The reported data may not be from this study.
* A post hoc analysis is needed to determine whether in the pure and support condition the averages are significantly higher than in the control group.


Solution
========
In this research 3 different conditions are compared with each other. By finding a significant difference between these groups (p < .001), we don't know yet which of the 3 groups differ from each other. This requires a post-hoc analysis.
