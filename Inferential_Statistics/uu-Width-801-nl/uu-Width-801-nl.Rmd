
Question
========
A psychologist examined the effect of chronic alcohol abuse on memory. In this experiment, a standardized test was used. Higher scores on the test indicate better memory. Scores on this test for the general population form a normal distribution with $\mu = 50$ and $\sigma = 8$. A sample of 22 alcohol abusers has a mean score of $M = 47$. The level of significance is 5%.


What is the 95% confidence interval for the mean memory score for alcohol abusers?
