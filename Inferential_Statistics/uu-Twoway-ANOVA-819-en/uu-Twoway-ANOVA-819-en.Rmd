Question
========
  
The grades of a group of students in the Statistics I course at a Boston university is used to answer the question of whether grade for this course depends on subject of study (major) and sex (gender).

The researchers randomly selected the students from course files. Closer inspection reveals that there are several students in the sample who have a double major. The grades of a few students are listed under both Social Science and Languages. The grades of two more students are listed under both Econ/Political Science and Languages.

Which condition of the two-way ANOVA did the researchers violate with this?

  
Answerlist
----------
* Random sample
* Independence of observations
* Equal variances
* Normal distribution of numbers

Answerlist
----------
* Random sample. This condition is not violated, since a random sample was drawn, or a random sample
* Independence of observations. This condition is violated because there are students who are in more than 1 of the groups. It is important in an ANOVA that there are independent groups. This is not the case.
* Equal variances. This condition is an important one in this test, but this is not what the question is about.
* Normal distribution of numbers.This condition is an important one with this test, but this is not what the question is about.
