Question
========
A researcher draws a sample of 50 Dutch citizens and examines whether
the confidence of the Dutch in politics is higher than the European
average, of which we have a reliable population value based on previous
studies.  
  
The sample mean is 6.38 (on a scale of 0-10) and the standard deviation
is 1.55. The European average is 6.0. Test, with alpha = 0.05, whether
the confidence of the Dutch in politics is higher than the European
average. What is the conclusion?

Answerlist
----------
* There is enough evidence to reject H<sub>0</sub>
* There is *not* enough evidence to reject H<sub>0</sub>
* There is enough evidence to reject H<sub>a.</sub>
* There is *not* enough evidence to reject H <sub>a.</sub>

Solution
========





You can not reject the H<sub>a</sub> hypothesis, you can only reject the
H<sub>0</sub> hypothesis.  
In order to undertake hypothesis testing you need to express your
research hypothesis as a null and alternative hypothesis. The null
hypothesis and alternative hypothesis are statements regarding the
differences or effects that occur in the population. You will use your
sample to test which statement (i.e., the null hypothesis or alternative
hypothesis) is most likely (although technically, you test the evidence
against the null hypothesis). You can reject or not reject the
H<sub>0 </sub>hypothesis.  
  
  
The H<sub>0</sub> hypothesis in this example states that the mean
confidence of the Dutch in politics is 6.38. The H<sub>a</sub>
hypothesis is that the mean is higher than 6.38.  
  
  
se=1.55/(sqrt 50)=0.22  
  
  
t= (6.38-6.00)/0.22=1.73  
  
  
The t critical value (see table) for one tailed test (df=50) is 1.68.
So, there is enough evidence to reject H<sub>0</sub>
