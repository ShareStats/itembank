Answerlist
----------
* We find empirical evidence for the proposition that the language test had an effect had, because the observed t-value is **greater** than the critical t-value.
* We find empirical evidence for the proposition that the language test had an effect had, because the observed t-value is **smaller** than the critical t-value.
* We find **no** empirical evidence for the proposition that the language test had had an effect, because the observed t-value is **greater** than the critical t-value.
