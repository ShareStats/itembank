Question
========

Two linear mixed models are used: an "empty" model with no fixed effect of time (2 parameters, -2Log-Likelihood=413.45), and a model with a linear fixed effect of time (3 parameters, -2Log-Likelihood=409.25).

Perform a likelihood-ratio test to test whether there is a linear fixed effect of time. 
Answerlist
----------
* $\chi^{2}(df = 1) = 4.20;\;p < .05$
* $\chi^{2}(df = 1) = 4.20;\;p > .05$
* $\chi^{2}(df = 3) = 4.20;\;p < .05$
