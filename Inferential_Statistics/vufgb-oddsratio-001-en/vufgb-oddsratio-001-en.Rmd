Question
========
We consider a binary logistic regression analysis. The results show that *b* = 0.75 with 95% confidence interval of (0.20; 1.30). Calculate the point estimate and 95% confidence interval of the *odds ratio* (OR).

Answerlist
----------
* OR = 2.12 with 95% BI of (1.22; 3.67).
* OR = -0.29 with 95% BI of (-1.61; 0.26).
* OR = 3.00 with 95% BI of (0.25; 3.75).
* OR = -0.12 with 95% BI of (-0.70; 0.11).
