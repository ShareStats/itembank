Question
========
  
The number of violent crimes in the Netherlands is normally distributed with an average $\mu = 2.6$ per day and a standard deviation $\sigma = 0.5$. One researcher hypothesized that violent crime rates increase in hot weather. In a sample of 25 warm days, an average of 2.8 violent crimes per day is found. The researcher performs a one-sided z-test. At what significance level $\alpha$ Is the null hypothesis rejected? 
Answerlist
----------
* The $H_0$ is rejected at $\alpha$ = 5%, but not at $\alpha$ = 1%.
* The $H_0$ is rejected at $\alpha$ = 1%, but not at $\alpha$ = 5%.
* The $H_0$ becomes both at $\alpha$ = 5% as at $\alpha$ = 1% rejected.
* The $H_0$ is rejected neither at $\alpha$ = 5% nor at $\alpha$ = 1% rejected.
