Question
========
  
For a research assignment, a psychology student asks a large group of students at Utrecht University how many friends they have on their Hyves. He also asks whether the students have a (side) job. He expects that students with jobs will have fewer Hyves friends than students without jobs. He also wants to see if there are differences between female and male students. The results of the analysis are below.
