Question
========

Many secondary school teachers struggle with the question of how to deal with disturbances. Commonly used light sanctions like warning have little effect on the disturbance, and heavy sanctions like removal from class sometimes backfire because they can lead to status elevation of the affected student. One study examined the effect on classroom calm of a new type of sanction, the writing task. This requires students to write an essay about their own behavior. In this experiment, three groups were distinguished: teachers who merely warned students (repeatedly), teachers who removed students from class in case of disorder, and teachers who gave students a writing task. The number of disturbances two weeks after the intervention was examined.

In this case, why is it better to conduct an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test rather than three separate t-tests? 
Answerlist
----------
* Variance analysis clarifies which groups differ from each other with one test.
* Variance analysis better fits the measurement level of the dependent variable, number of disturbances after the intervention.
* Variance analysis gives a smaller chance of falsely finding a difference between the groups in the number of disturbances after the intervention.
* Variance analysis gives a smaller chance of finding a type II error.
