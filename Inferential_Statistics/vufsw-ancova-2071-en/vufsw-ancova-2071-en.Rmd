Question
========
Below are a number of output tables of a series of ANOVA and ANCOVA
analyses of cultural participation, measured at time 1 (culpar\_1:
before the CJP was distributed) and at time 2 (culpar\_2) among the same
respondents who can be divided into two groups: a group that did not
receive a CJP and a group that received a CJP between time 1 and 2 (a
group that already had a CJP was not considered).

a CJP in their cultural participation.
