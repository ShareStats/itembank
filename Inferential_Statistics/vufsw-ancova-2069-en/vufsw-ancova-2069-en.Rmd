Question
========
Below are a number of output tables of a series of ANOVA and ANCOVA
analyses of cultural participation, measured at time 1 (culpar\_1:
before the CJP was distributed) and at time 2 (culpar\_2) among the same
respondents who can be divided into two groups: a group that did not
receive a CJP and a group that received a CJP between time 1 and 2 (a
group that already had a CJP was not considered).

How can you test whether the assumption of the 'homogeneity of
regression slopes' of ANCOVA is fulfilled?

Answerlist
----------
* By adding the interaction between culpar\_1 and cjp to analysis 2; the
  F-value of the 'corrected model' tests this assumption
* By adding to analysis 2 the interaction between culpar\_1 and cjp; the
  F-value of the interaction effect between the two tests the assumption
* By taking culpar\_1 as the dependent variable and cjp as the
  independent; the F-value of the corrected model tests this assumption
* By taking culpar\_1 as the dependent variable and cjp as the
  independent; the F-value of the interaction effect between the two tests
  the assumption
