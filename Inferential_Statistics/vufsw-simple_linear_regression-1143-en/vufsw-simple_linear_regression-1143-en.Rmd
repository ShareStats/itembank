Question
========
A researcher wants to investigate within a group of employees whether
the income (measured by the net monthly salary in euros) has an
influence on the degree of absenteeism (measured by the number of missed
days due to illness during the past year). Which statistical technique
or test is most suitable for testing this?

Answerlist
----------
* Regression analysis to predict the number of missed days per year with
  the income.
* A t-test for 'independent samples' to test the effect of the income on
  the number of missed days.
* A t-test for 'paired (dependent) samples' to test the effect of the
  income on the number of missed days
* A Chi squared test to test the association between the income and the
  number of missed days.

Solution
========





A t-test is for comparing two means and a chi square test is to test a
categorical association. The correct answer is a regression analysis to
predict the number of missed days per year with the income.
