Question
========
Men and women often comment on each other's driving in the car. We look at the gender of who is behind the wheel [Driver, where male = 0, female = 1], what make of car someone drives [Car, where Ford = 1, Audi = 2, Toyota = 3, and Volkswagen = 4], the miles driven [Driven_kilometers] and the miles as a co-driver [Co-driver_kilometers]. We also look at who received a collision and who did not [Collision, where no collision = 0, did collision = 1].

What is the Relative Risk (RR) of getting a collision [Collision] of men relative to women [Driver]? Write the Relative Risk found in the answer box (using 3 decimal places).
