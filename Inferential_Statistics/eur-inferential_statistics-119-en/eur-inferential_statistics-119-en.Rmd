Answerlist
----------
* Both statements are true
* I is true, II is false
* I is false, I is true

Within-subjects designs require less participants than between subjects-designs, because differences between individuals matters less in the former design. Furthermore, if we only have one independent variable, it must consist of at least 2 conditions that will be compared to each other.
