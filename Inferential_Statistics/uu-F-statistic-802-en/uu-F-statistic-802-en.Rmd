Question
========
  
A sample of 235 students in the Faculty of Social Sciences at Utrecht University are given a questionnaire to complete about feelings. One of the questions read, "What do you think about your own height?" The response categories were: too short, about right, too tall. A total score was calculated for all students; it measures students' self-esteem. The results of the self-esteem scores are compared between the three height-sensitive groups and between boys and girls. The F-ratio for the interaction effect between height-feelings and gender is $4.98$ with a $p$-value of $.008$.

How is the $p$-value of $.008$ calculated?

  
Answerlist
----------
* The area to the right of $F = 4.98$ Under the F-distribution.
* The area to the left of $F = 4.98$ Under the F-distribution.
* The area to the left of $F = −4.98$ en rechts van $F = 4.98$ Under the F-distribution.
* The area between $F = -4.98$ and $F = 4.98$ under the F distribution.
