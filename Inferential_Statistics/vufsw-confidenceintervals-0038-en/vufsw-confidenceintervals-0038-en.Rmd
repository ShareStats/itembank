Question
========
Below is a small section from a research report on the level of employee
satisfaction in a large organisation. A text and a number have been
omitted from this research report.  
  
"The level of job satisfaction was measured by means of 8 questions.
Each of these questions had the following five response options: totally
disagree (1), disagree (2), disagree, disagree (3), agree (4), totally
agree (5). A scale was constructed by taking the average score of these
8 items per respondent.  
  
The data from our sample showed that women differ significantly from men
in the degree of satisfaction with their work. In fact, the calculation
of \[---text ---\] shows that the difference between the mean scores of
the two groups is significantly different from \[---number---\]."  
  
What is the correct text and number?
