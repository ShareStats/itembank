Question
========
Two Dutch language tests were submitted to 20 respondents: the first
measurement took place prior to listening to the King's Song, the second
measurement after they had listened to this song attentively. The
researcher wanted to know if your Dutch knowledge deteriorates if you
listened to the song. He always noted the number of language mistakes
made by the respondents. Below are the results.  
   

<table class="tvcss_2 tvcss_3">
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>N                       </td>
<td class="tvcss_4">mean number of mistakes (measurement 1)</td>
<td class="tvcss_5">mean number of mistakes (measurement 2)</td>
<td class="tvcss_6">mean difference</td>
<td class="tvcss_7">standard error (se) of the mean difference
score</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>20</td>
<td class="tvcss_4">30.45</td>
<td class="tvcss_5">34.20</td>
<td class="tvcss_6">-3.75</td>
<td class="tvcss_7">0.88</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

  
What is the margin of error of the 95% confidence interval of the mean
difference score?

Answerlist
----------
* 0.41
* 1.84
* 2.09
* 3.75

Solution
========





Margin of error = Critical value x Standard deviation for the
population.  
Margin of error = Critical value x Standard error of the sample.  
  
the standard error of the sample is given:0.88  
The critical value (df(19)=2.09  
Margin of error=0.88\*2.09=1.84
