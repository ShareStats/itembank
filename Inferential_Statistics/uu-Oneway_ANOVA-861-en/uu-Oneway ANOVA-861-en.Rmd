Question
========
In a study on school enjoyment, grade 7 students from a number of elementary schools were asked a questionnaire with eight questions measuring school enjoyment (or lack thereof). For all questions there were four response categories where a high score meant that the student enjoyed going to school. An analysis of variance was used to determine whether boys and girls differ in school enjoyment. It was tested with $\alpha$ = 5%. The SPSS output is shown below.

What is the conclusion based on this output?

Answerlist
----------
* Boys and girls differ significantly in school fun; a post hoc analysis should reveal whether boys or girls have more fun
* Boys and girls differ significantly in school fun; boys have more fun than girls
* Boys and girls do not differ in school fun; therefore, a post hoc analysis must be conducted
* The question of whether boys and girls differ in school fun can only be answered with an Independent samples T-test, not with analysis of variance.
