Answerlist
----------
* H<sub>0</sub>: all βs are 0. We reject the null hypothesis because the p-value is less than 0.05.
* H<sub>0</sub>: all βs are 0. We reject the null hypothesis **not** because the p-value is smaller than 0,05.
* H<sub>0</sub>: The explained variance (R<sup>2</sup>) = 1. We reject the null hypothesis because the p-value is smaller than 0.05.
* H<sub>0</sub>: The explained variance (R<sup>2</sup>) = 1. We reject the null hypothesis **not** because the p-value is smaller than 0,05.
