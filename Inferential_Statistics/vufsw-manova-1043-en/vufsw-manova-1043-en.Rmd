Question
========
Which of the following statements is true about MANOVA  
  
I. MANOVA controls for the overall error rate, ensuring that the risk of
Type I errors does not increase.  
II. MANOVA is suitable to study the effect of an experimental
manipulation on dependent variables which are not correlated with each
other.

Answerlist
----------
* Statement I is correct and statement II is incorrect.
* Statement I is incorrect and statement II is correct.
* Both statements are correct.
* Both statements are incorrect.

Solution
========





By analyzing simultaneously several dependent variables MANOVA corrects
for the familywise error rate. Thus, the statement "It controls for the
overall error rate, ensuring that the risk of Type I errors does not
increase." is correct.  
  
MANOVA studies the effect of (at least one) independent variable on
several dependent variables that are correlated with each other. If they
are uncorrelation with each other, MANOVA makes no sense. therefore the
statement" It is suitable to study the effect of an experimental
manipulation on dependent variables which are not correlated with each
other." is incorrect
