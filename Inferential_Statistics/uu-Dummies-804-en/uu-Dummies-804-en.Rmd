Suppose you have three equally sized groups (variable medication level) with the following group averages on variable depression: Mean group medication low: M = 40 Average group medication medium: M = 30 Mean group medication high: M = 20

To represent the effects of medication level on depression, you set up a regression equation with two dummy variables. You choose group medication high as the reference group. In the regression equation:

I. the constant equals 20 II. the regression coefficient of the dummy for group medication low equals 20.
