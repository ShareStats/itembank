Question
========

In a sample of girls, we found that they lost weight after 15 months ($M = âˆ’3.1$ kg). Using a statistical test, this difference in average weight is significant. What kind of statistical error may have occurred?

Answerlist
----------
* An error of the first kind: $H_0$ has been rejected, but there is actually no difference at all.
* An error of the second kind: $H_0$ is not rejected, but there is a difference.
* An error of the first kind: $H_1$ is assumed, but in real life the difference is much greater.
* An error of the first and second kind can both: in statistical tests, you simply take the chance of making an error. 

Solution
========

It is an error of the first kind: $H_0$ has been rejected, but there is really no difference at all.

Answerlist
----------
* Indeed!
* It is concluded that the difference is significant. Being $H_0$ then rejected or not rejected?
* This is incorrect.
* This is incorrect.
