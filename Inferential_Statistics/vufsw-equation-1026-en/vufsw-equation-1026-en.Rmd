Question
========
If you were researching the effect of *hours *of training (predictor)
and *attitude *(moderator) on the performance of a specific skill (e.g.
the number of goals scored: *performance*) and the regression results
give you the following regression equation, which of the following
statements is ***in*****correct**?  
  
*All the variables in this regression are mean-centred.*  
  
*p**e**r**f**o**r**m**a**n**c**e* = 1.23<sup>\*</sup> + 0.112 × *a**t**t**i**t**u**d**e* + 0.531<sup>\*</sup> × *h**o**u**r**s* + 0.167<sup>\*</sup> × *a**t**t**i**t**u**d**e* × *h**o**u**r**s*  
  
\* indicates a statistically significant effect

Answerlist
----------
* The effect of hours training on the performance of a specific skill is
  lower for higher scores of attitude than for lower scores of attitude.
* The effect of hours training on the performance of a specific skill is
  higher for higher scores of attitude than for lower scores of attitude.
* The mean score in performance in a specific skill equals 1.23 if hours
  of training and attitude equal its mean values.
* If the variable hours of training equal its mean, then an increase of
  attitude by 1 unit results in a mean increase of performance by 0.112
  units.

Solution
========





The correct answer is the option "*The effect of hours training on the
performance of a specific skill is lower for higher scores of attitude
than for lower scores of attitude"*. This is correct because the
statement is incorrect! The regression equation shows that the
interaction effect (0.167) is positive and not negative as the statement
suggests. This means that the effect of hours on performance increases
with attitude.  
  
The option "*The effect of hours training on the performance of a
specific skill is higher for higher scores of attitude than for lower
scores of attitude*" is incorrect because the statement is correct! The
regression equation shows that the interaction effect (0.167) is
positive. This means that the effect of hours on performance increases
with attitude.  
  
The option "*The mean score in performance in a specific skill equals
1.23 if hours of training and attitude equal its mean values*" is
incorrect because the statement is correct! Both attitude and hours are
mean-centred, so when these variables take their mean value, they should
be replaced with 0 in the regression equation. This means that in that
case, performance would equal the constant = 1.23.  
*p**e**r**f**o**r**m**a**n**c**e* = 1.23<sup>\*</sup> + 0.112 × *a**t**t**i**t**u**d**e* + 0.531<sup>\*</sup> × *h**o**u**r**s* + 0.167<sup>\*</sup> × *a**t**t**i**t**u**d**e* × *h**o**u**r**s* = 1.23 + 0.112 × 0 + 0.531<sup>\*</sup> × 0 + 0.167<sup>\*</sup> × 0 × 0 = 1.23  
  
The option "*If the variable hours of training equal its mean, then an
increase of attitude by 1 unit results in a mean increase of performance
by 0.112 units*" is incorrect because the statement is correct! Hours
training is mean-centred, so when this variable takes its mean value, it
should be replaced with 0 in the regression equation. In this case, the
effect of attitude on performance is 0.112.  
  
*p**e**r**f**o**r**m**a**n**c**e* = 1.23<sup>\*</sup> + 0.112 × *a**t**t**i**t**u**d**e* + 0.531<sup>\*</sup> × *h**o**u**r**s* + 0.167<sup>\*</sup> × *a**t**t**i**t**u**d**e* × *h**o**u**r**s* = 1.23 + 0.112 × *a**t**t**i**t**u**d**e* + 0.531<sup>\*</sup> × 0 + 0.167<sup>\*</sup> × *a**t**t**i**t**u**d**e* × 0 = 1.23 + 0.112 × *a**t**t**i**t**u**d**e*
