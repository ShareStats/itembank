Question
========

A master's thesis student examines the relationship between growing up in a chaotic household ($D_{1}$: 0=not, 1=well) and ADHD symptoms in children (*Y*). She hypothesized that the strength of this relationship depends on having or not having a risk allele in a dopamine gene ($D_{2}$: 0=not, 1=well). She finds the following estimated regression equation: 

$Y'= 7+3D_{1}+5D_{2}+4D_{1}D_{2}$.

Calculate the predicted score on ADHD symptoms if a child did grow up in a chaotic household, but has no risk allele in the dopamine gene.
