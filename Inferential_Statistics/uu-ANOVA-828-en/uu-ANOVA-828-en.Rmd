Question
========
  
Suppose that master's students, before beginning their master's track, must take an entrance exam and the scores on it are coded as "insufficient," "satisfactory," or "good/excellent." After the entrance exam, students can begin their master's track.

Which analysis technique is best suited to see if the grade point average in the master's program differs among the three groups?

  
Answerlist
----------
* ANOVA
* T-test for independent samples
* $\chi^2$ test for independence.
* $\chi^2$ key for goodness of fit 


Solution
========
The dependent variable is "the grade point average in the master," and this variable is continuous and of ratio (or interval) measurement level. There is one independent variable, namely entrance exam scores. This is categorical and of ordinal measurement level with 3 levels. Comparing two or more groups on a variable of interval or ratio measurement level is possible with analysis of variance (ANOVA).

The remaining answers are incorrect because:
- Option 2: There are three groups and not two.
- Option 3: One $\chi^2$ test of independence is not appropriate with a dependent variable of interval measurement level with many different values.
- Option 4: A $\chi^2$ key for goodness of fit is niet geschikt bij een afhankelijke variabele van interval meetniveau met veel verschillende waarden.
