Question
========
The idea is that injustice will lead to counterproductive behavior (counter productive behavior = "**CB**"), such as tardiness, stealing office supplies, low collegiality and the like. The question is what mechanism, if any, links justice and "**CB**." The idea is that unjust procedures lead to more "**CB**." Next, we can we can ask why procedural injustice leads to "**CB**" leads. One possibility is that procedural injustice undermines trust in management and that the lack of trust will lead to more "**CB**." Conversely, experiencing procedural justice ("**PR**") will increase trust ("**TRUST**") and thereby decrease counterproductive behavior ("**CB**").  
  
We obtain the following output from a hierarchical regression belonging to this study.  
What is the unstandardized indirect effect of this mediation analysis?
