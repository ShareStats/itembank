Question
========
  
In research on twins, a distinction is often made between identical and twin twins. A questionnaire (with 5-point Likert scale) is used to examine social behavior of identical twins. Is there a difference between the oldest (first-born) twin and the youngest? Ten pairs of twins participate in this little study. The oldest twins had a mean test score of 3.6 and the youngest twins had a mean of 3.3, for a mean difference of MD = 0.3. The SS for the difference scores was 3.43.

Is there a significant difference between the oldest and youngest twins at $\alpha$ = 0.10?

Answerlist
----------

* Yes, because t > tcrit = 1.383
* No, because t < tcritical = 1.883
* No, because t < tcritical = 1.383
* Yes, because t > tcritical = 1.883


Solution
========
The difference between the oldest and youngest twins is not significant because t<tcrit=1.883
