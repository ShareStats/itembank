Question
========
  
In a multiple regression model, two predictors ($x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$) and the interaction between $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ included ($x_{1}*x_{2}$). What is, after centering the predictors $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, the correct interpretation of the regression coefficient ($b_{1}$) associated with the first predictor? 
Answerlist
----------
* The estimated relationship between $x_{1}$ and y given $x_{2} = 0$
* The approximate relationship between $x_{1}$ and y given an average score on $x_{2}$.
* The estimated relationship between $x_{1}$ and y given that $x_{2}$ remains constant
* The approximate relationship between $x_{1}$ and y given a constant of 0
