Question
========
  
A middle school uses teaching method A for mathematics; the average grade for this teaching method is $\mu$A = 6.67 with $sigma$ = 2. The principal of the school wants to switch to teaching method B which, according to the designers of the method, has an average of $\mu$B = 7.00 has. The math teachers, however, are skeptical and want proof first. They therefore decide to have a sample of 100 students take teaching method B in the next semester. Should it turn out that in this sample the H0: $\mu$B â‰¤ $\mu$A with $alpha$ = 5% can be rejected, then the school will switch to teaching method B. If the designers of teaching method are right and $\mu$B is indeed equal to 7.00, how likely is the school to switch to teaching method B (i.e., what is the power of the test)?
