Answerlist
----------
* The covariate has already explained most of the dispersion. This led to a smaller between-group spread, making the differences between the groups relatively larger.
* The inclusion of the covariate led to a larger between-group spread, resulting in a smaller F-ratio.
* Including the covariate led to a smaller within-group spread. The corrected averages are further apart this way.
* The covariate already explained most of the spread. This leads to a smaller intermediate dispersion, making the differences between the groups relatively smaller.
