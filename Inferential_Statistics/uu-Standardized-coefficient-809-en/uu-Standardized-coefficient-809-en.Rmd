Question
========
The hourly wage of teachers (SALERY PER HOUR) can be predicted with a multiple regression model from the number of years of experience a teacher has (EXPERIENCE) and how well the teacher is perceived (QUALITY). The quality of the teacher is the average peer rating. The SPSS output of the regression analysis is shown. 

![](uu-Standardized-coefficient-809-nl-tabel.jpg)

Which of the two variables, EXPERIENCE or QUALITY, is the most important predictor of SALARY PER HOUR and why?

Answerlist
----------
* The variable QUALITY, because this variable has the highest standardized regression coefficient of the two predictors.
* The variable QUALITY, because this variable has the highest regression coefficient of the two predictors.
* The variable EXPERIENCE, because this variable has the highest p-value of the two predictors.
* The variable EXPERIENCE, because this variable has the smallest standard error (Std. Error) of the two predictors.


Solution
========
To determine which variable is the most significant predictor, 3 aspects can be looked at:
- p-value: a more significant predictor is more important than a less significant predictor. A smaller p-value means more significance (because of this, C is erroneous, because wrong-sum).
- t-value: a higher t-value means the predictor is more significant. This option is not among the answer options.
- Beta: standardized regression coefficients are given here. A higher beta means a more important predictor. This leads to the correct answer: A. Both regression coefficient (B) and standard error (Std. Error) cannot be used to locate the most significant predictor without additional information about the scales.
