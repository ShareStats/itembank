A researcher is interested in the effect of physical exercise (*z* = 0 for no physical exercise, *z* = 1 for physical exercise) on *y* = working memory. In doing so, she wants to control for *x* = age. The regression equation is $\hat{y} = 120+10z-0.5x$. The average age is 60 for no physical activity and 50 for physical activity. The overall mean age is 55. Calculate the adjusted mean ("adjusted mean") of working memory for well physical exercise.
