----------
* 2
* 4

In a repeated measures analysis, all participants participate in all different conditions. A 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 design means that there are four factors, each with two different values.

For example: factor 1 = A or B, factor 2 = X or Y, factor 3 = 1 or 2 and factor 4 = # or *. A total of the following 16 combinations are then possible: AX1# AY1# BX1# BY1# AX1* AY1* BX1* BY1* AX2# AY2# BX2# BY2# AX2* AY2* BX2* BY2*
