Question
========
The analyses below are based on data from the research project Youth and
Culture (Ganzeboom and Nagel, 1998-2002) in which over 3,000 school
pupils aged 14-17 were questioned about their attitude towards culture.
There is also information about their social background and their
parents' cultural participation. The question is to what extent the
cultural participation of the mother influences the students' attitude
towards culture and whether this influence differs between students from
western and non-western backgrounds.  
  
The dependent variable is 'Attitude to culture' (ATT: a 1-4 scale, where
a higher score means a more positive attitude). Mother's cultural
participation (MCUL) is a continuous scale, 0-1, where a higher score
means higher participation. The western versus non-western background of
the students was measured via the variable 'MIN' (0 = western, 1 =
non-western). Model 2 also includes the interaction between 'MIN' and
'MCUL' (MIN\_MCUL).

In regression model 1, the t-value of MCUL is omitted.Â   
What is the t-value? *Give a number with one decimal*
