Question
========
A researcher wants to check whether the average atmosphere during Ajax
matches differs significantly from the atmosphere at Feyenoord matches.
He counts the number of incidents (instances of misconduct by
supporters) during 16 matches of both clubs: at Ajax the average number
of incidents per game is 1.95 and at Feyenoord this is an average of
1.70. The researcher then calculates a 95% confidence interval of the
difference between the two means, μ Ajax -– μ Feyenoord. This interval
appears to be (-0.25, 0.72)  
  
The researcher concludes that the atmosphere between the matches of both
clubs does not differ significantly from each other. What can this be
derived from?

Answerlist
----------
* The critical t-value for a two-tailed test with alpha = 0.05 and df = 30
  (16 + 16 - 2) is 2.042. This number is outside the interval.
* The number 0 is within the interval.
* The number 0.05 is within the interval.
* The number 0.95 is outside the interval.

Solution
========





The number 0 is within the interval, thus the atmosphere between the
matches of both clubs does not differ significantly from each other..


Answerlist
----------
* False
* True
* False
* False
