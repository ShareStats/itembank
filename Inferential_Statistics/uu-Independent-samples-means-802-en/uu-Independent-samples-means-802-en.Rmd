Question
========
  
In a study of the effect of preferred hand on driving ability, 217 subjects were randomly drawn from the population of car drivers who were followed for 2 years. During that period, the 27 left-handed subjects made an average of 1.3 car accidents and the 190 right-handed subjects made 0.77 car accidents. Based on these data, a two-sided t-test for two independent groups was performed with Î± = 5%. What do you conclude from the SPSS output shown below regarding equality of variances and significance of the effect of preferred hand on the number of accidents?
