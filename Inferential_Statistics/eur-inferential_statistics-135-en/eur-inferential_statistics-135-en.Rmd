Question
========
A researcher is interested in the influence of the drop in price for gasoline (bezine) on students who own a car. He wants to predict how many kilometers they will drive in in Januari 2015 [KM_JAN] by using a few predictors. For 202 students, the researcher has gathered the following data: 1) actual driven kilometers in Jan 2015 [KM_JAN], 2) actual driven kilometers in October 2014 [KM_OCT], 3) income for January 2015 [INCOME_JAN], 4) total kilometers traveled using public transport for February 2015 [PUB_TRANS], and 5) type of car [car] (1 = hybrid, 2 = sedan, 3 = suv).
