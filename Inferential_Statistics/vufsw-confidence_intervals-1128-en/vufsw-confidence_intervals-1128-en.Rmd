Question
========
22 randomly selected German journalists (group 1) and 20 randomly
selected Argentinian journalists (group 2) were asked to assess the
quality of the German football team. The response scale ranges from 0
(very bad) to 10 (very good). The (fictitious) results show that the
German group gives an average of 8.3 and the Argentinian group an
average of 7.9. A researcher wants to check whether the assessment
differs significantly between both groups. It calculates the 95%
confidence interval of the difference in averages, μ1- μ2. This interval
appears to be (0.15, 0.65).  
  
The researcher concludes that the assessments of the two groups differ
significantly from each other. What can this be derived from?

Answerlist
----------
* The critical t-value in a two-way test with significance level = 0.05
  and df = 40 is 2.02. This number is outside the interval.
* The number 0.00 is outside the interval.
* The number 0.05 is outside the interval.
* The number 0.95 is outside the interval.

Solution
========





The number 0.00 is outside the interval, therefore you can conclude that
the assessments of the two groups differ significantly from each other


Answerlist
----------
* False
* True
* False
* False
