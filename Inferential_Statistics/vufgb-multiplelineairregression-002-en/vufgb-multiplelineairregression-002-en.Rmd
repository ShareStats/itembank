Question
========
  
A simple linear regression shows a positive association between the stress hormone cortisol ($x_{1}$) and depressive symptoms (*y*). When in a multiple linear regression, one statistically controls for negative life events ($x_{2}$), the association between cortisol and depressive symptoms disappears.
