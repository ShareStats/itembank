Question
========
Below are the results of two separate regressions (for women and men
separately). "Gender" is a dummy variable that measures one's sex (0 =
male; 1 = female). The dependent variable "CGPA" stands for one's
College Grade Point Average and measures one's study performance on a
scale from 2.5 (minimum score) to 4.0 (maximum score). "WatchTV" is a
variable that indicates how many minutes per day a person usually spends
watching TV.  
What is the correct regression equation for women?
