Question
========

To examine whether a relationship exists between the variables x and y a regression analysis is performed. Before the analysis is performed, a number of assumptions for testing for regression coefficients are checked. First, the values of x and y are plotted on a graph. From the graph, it seems likely the assumption of regression violated which states that
