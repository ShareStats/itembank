Question
========
The analysis below deals with the potential harmful effects of cell phones. Field imagines a fictional experiment in which subjects are strapped a cell phone to their head and TRUE in which this phone is turned on for a fixed number of hours each day. After six months, the extent of any damage is measured near the ear (variable: ear damage, amount of ear damage). Six groups distinguished, who 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 hours per day (variable: usage) were exposed to these 'phone microwaves'.

How can we summarize the results of the analysis?

Answerlist
----------
* The F test shows that it is plausible that the mean 'ear-damage' in the groups is not equal, but the assumption of homogeneity of variances met, so we cannot definite statements
* The F test shows that there is insufficient evidence that the mean 'ear-damage' in the groups is not equal, but the assumption of homogeneity of variances met, so we cannot make any make definitive statements
* The F test shows that there is insufficient evidence that the mean 'ear-damage' in the groups is not equal. Because the assumption of homogeneity of variances is met, this is the summary of the outcomes.
* The F test indicates that it is plausible that the mean 'ear-damage' in the groups is not equal. Because the assumption of homogeneity of variances is met, this is the summary of the results.
