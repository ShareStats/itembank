…

Answerlist
----------
* Weakly correlate.
* Moderately correlate.
* Perfectly correlate.
* Very strongly correlate.

Solution
========





The intuition is that since MANOVA accounts for the correlation between
the dependent variables, then if the dependent variables are not
correlated then there is no need for a MANOVA and you can run simple
ANOVAs. If there is a very high correlation, then by explaining the
variance in one of the dependent variables, you explain what you can
explain with this model. So, again there is no need for a MANOVA.
