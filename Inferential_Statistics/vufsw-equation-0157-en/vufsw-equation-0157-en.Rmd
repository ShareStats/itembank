Question
========
For her Master thesis, a student used an experimental design to
investigate whether test persons who had to read an unfavourable news
item gave a less positive assessment of the image of a certain company
than test persons who had to read a neutral news item. The assessment
was measured on a scale from 1 (very negative) to 5 (very positive).  
  
Transform the data below into a regression equation. The dependent
variable (Y) is the rating of the image ("Rating") and the independent
variable (X) indicates the group ("EXPGROEP= experimentele groep, groep
1"), where the control group ("controle groep, groep 2") is the
reference category (control group = 0; experimental group = 1).  
  
The results show that the mean rating of the two groups is as follows:

Answerlist
----------
* Rating = 3,20 + 0,40 \* EXPGROEP
* Rating = 3,60 – 0,20 \* EXPGROEP
* Rating = 0,20 + 3,40 \* EXPGROEP
* Rating = 3,40 – 3,60 \* EXPGROEP
* Rating = 3,40 – 0,20 \* EXPGROEP
* Rating = 3,60 + 3,40 \* EXPGROEP
