Question
========
  
Albert is administering a test to test the effect of a treatment. He expects an increase in scores of 2 points. Under normal circumstances, the average score is 12. So he wants to test: H0: $\mu$ = 12 vs. H1: $\mu$ = 14.

There were 30 people participating in the experiment. Albert tests at $\alpha$ = .10 and assumes that the standard deviation is equal to 3. What is the power of this test?
