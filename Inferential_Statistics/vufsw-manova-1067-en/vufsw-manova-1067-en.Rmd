Question
========
Which of the following 2 statements is/are correct for discriminant
analysis as a follow-up to MANOVA?  
  
I. Discriminant analysis predicts the category of experimental
manipulation from the dependent variables of MANOVA  
II. With discriminant analysis we decide which of the 4 tests of MANOVA
(Pillai's trace, Roy's Largest Root, Wilk's Lamda and Hotellings Trace)
to use.

Answerlist
----------
* Both statements I and II are correct
* Both statements I and II are **in**correct
* Statement I is correct, while statement II is **in**correct
* Statement I is **in**correct, while statement II is correct

Solution
========





The  statement "Discriminant analysis predicts the category of
experimental manipulation from the dependent variables of MANOVA" is
correct. Discriminant Analysis turns around the situation of MANOVA. The
dependent variables of MANOVA are used as predictors in discriminant
analysis, while the independent variable of MANOVA (the experimental
manipulation) is the dependent variable.  
  
The  statement " With discriminant analysis we decide which of the 4
tests of MANOVA (Pillai's trace, Roy's Largest Root, Wilk's Lamda and
Hotellings Trace) to use" is incorrect. Discriminant analysis has
nothing to do with it.
