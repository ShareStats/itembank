Question
========
  
Below is an incomplete ANOVA table for comparing the mean scores of four groups. How large is the F-ratio and is the result significant when tested with $\alpha$ = .01?

Answerlist
----------
* F = 2.6 and is significant at $\alpha$ = .01
* F = 2.6 and is not significant at $\alpha$  = .01
* F = 1.9 and is significant at $\alpha$ = .01
* F = 1.9 and is not significant at $\alpha$ = .01 

Solution
========
SSwithin = SStotal - SSbetween = 352.6-25.4 = 327.2 dfbetween = k - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 dfwithin = dftotal - dfbetween = 104 - 3 = 101.

MSbetween = SSbetween / dfbetween 25.4/3 = 8.47 MSwithin = SSwithin / dfwithin = 327.2/101 = 3.24

F = MSbetween/ MSwithin = 8.47/3.24 = 2.6

Fcritical at df 3, 100 (101 is not in there, so we look at 100) at = .01 is 3.98. The F value obtained is lower than Fcriticality, so the result is not significant at  = .01. If you determine the df incorrectly you end up with F = 1.9 (dfbetween = 4 and dfwithin = 100)
