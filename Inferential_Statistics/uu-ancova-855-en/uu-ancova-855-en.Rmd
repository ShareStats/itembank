The researcher therefore conducts a covariance analysis controlling for problem avoidance. The researcher obtains the following outputs, among others:

Is the condition of homogeneity of regression coefficients met?

Answerlist
----------
* No, because p = .004
* No, because p = .078
* Yes, because p = .004
* Yes, because p = .078

Solution
========
The condition of homogeneity of regression coefficients is met when the interaction effect between your factor (independent variable) and your covariate is not significant. The table shows that the p-value of the interaction effect is not significant (p = .078). Thus, the condition homogeneity of regression coefficients is met.
