Question
========
  
A random sample of employees at a large hospital is asked to complete a questionnaire about the satisfaction of work and working conditions within the hospital. Satisfaction scores range from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 7 (very satisfied). A researcher from the planning office conducting the survey will investigate whether full-time and part-time employees show differences in levels of job satisfaction. There were 25 full-time employees and 30 part-timers in the sample. Since the distribution of satisfaction scores was very skewed, the researcher uses a Mann-Whitney U test. The value of the test size is 267. Are there significant differences between full-time and part-time employees at $\alpha = .05$?


Answerlist
----------
* TRUE, because the test magnitude is less than the critical value.
* Yes, because 267 is greater than the critical value.
* Yes, because the p-value is less than .05.
* We cannot say that from the information given.
