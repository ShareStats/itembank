Question
========
On the basis of the output below, Field and Lawson (2003) reported the
effects of giving the same children aged 7–9 years positive, negative or
no information about novel animals. This variable was called 'Infotype'
(levels of Infotype were entered in the following order: positive
information, negative information, no information). The gender of the
child was also examined. The outcome was the centred time taken for the
children to put their hand in a box in which they believed either the
positive, negative or no information animal was housed. The assumption
of Sphericity is not violated.

Contrast analysis was performed on these data. Using the output given
above, report the Mean Square that is used in the testing whether
infotype led to significant differences irrespectively of gender. Round
your answer to **three **decimal places.


Solution
========





We look at the table with the Tests of Within Subject Effects. According
to the question, the assumption of sphericity is not violated.
Therefore, the correct answer is 4.588
