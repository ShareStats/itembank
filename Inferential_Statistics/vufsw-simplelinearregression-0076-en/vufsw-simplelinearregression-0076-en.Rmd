Question
========
A researcher conducted a regression analysis to predict a person's interest in politics (Y) based on how often a person per week reads news articles <span class="tvcss_2 tvcss_3 tvcss_4 tvcss_5 tvcss_6 tvcss_7">(X). </span>Political interest was measured using a scale ranging from 1 ('not at all interested') to 10 (<span class="tvcss_2 tvcss_3 tvcss_4 tvcss_5 tvcss_6 tvcss_7">'</span>very interested'). The formula associated with the regression line is shown below.  
What can you say about the **causality** between X and Y?

Answerlist
----------
* How often a person reads news articles per week is only causally related to one's political interest if there is no extrapolation occurs outside the observed range.
* How often someone reads news articles per week is causally related to one's political interest if there are no *prediction errors* (prediction errors).
* How often someone reads news articles per week is causally related to one's political interest if there are no *influential outliers* (influential outliers).
* We cannot draw a firm conclusion based on regression analysis draw about causality and should think carefully about possible alternative explanations for the relationship found.
