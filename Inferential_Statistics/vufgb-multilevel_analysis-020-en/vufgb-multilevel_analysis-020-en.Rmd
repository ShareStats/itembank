Question
========

Two nested binary logistic regression models are compared. The first model contains 1 predictor and gives a -2 Log-Likelihood value of 65. The second model contains 2 predictors and gives a -2 Log-Likelihood value of 62.

Perform a chi-square test to test whether the model with the second predictor explains significantly more than the model without the second predictor.
