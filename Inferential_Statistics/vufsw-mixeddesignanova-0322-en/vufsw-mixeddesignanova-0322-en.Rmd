Question
========
In a study of positive outcomes of mindfulness training, researchers wanted to examine the extent to which the light in the room and the duration of the training affect how people rate the training. In addition, they are curious whether these effects depend on the gender of the subjects. To investigate this, the researchers are giving 9 weeks of mindfulness training to subjects, each night with a different light in the room and with a different duration of the training. The sizes of the different types of light are dark, medium and light, and the duration of the training sessions are short (1), medium (2) and long (3). The subjects had to give a grade after each workout about how they workout had experienced. What method of analysis is best for researchers to best to use?
