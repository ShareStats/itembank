Question
========
  
Two linear mixed models are used: an "empty" model with no fixed effect of time (2 parameters, -2Log-Likelihood=2563.90), and a model with a linear fixed effect of time (3 parameters, -2Log-Likelihood=2561.57).

Perform a likelihood-ratio test to test whether there is a linear fixed effect of time. 
Answerlist
----------
* $\chi^{2}(df = 1) = 2.33;\;p < .05$
* $\chi^{2}(df = 1) = 2.33;\;p > .05$
* $\chi^{2}(df = 1) = 5.43;\;p < .05$
* $\chi^{2}(df = 1) = 5.43;\;p > .05$
