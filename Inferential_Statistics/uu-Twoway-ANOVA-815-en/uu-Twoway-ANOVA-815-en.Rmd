Answerlist
----------
* Islam

Solution
========
  
H0: $\mu$1 = $\mu$2 = $\mu$3 = $\mu$4 (when comparing four groups) Persons with Islam as a faith differ significantly in mean age at first marriage from those with a Protestant faith and those with a Catholic faith. There are no other differences between faith groups. Therefore, Islam makes the largest contribution to the rejection of H0.
