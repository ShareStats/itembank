A student at VU University Amsterdam conducted research into the use of
social media among young people. For his thesis he collected data on the
use of Facebook from 224 students. In the table below the gender of the
youngsters is plotted to the question whether they have a Facebook
account (actually observed numbers).

The researcher wants to know if female students are more often members
of Facebook than male students. He performs a Chi-square test and
receives a Chi-square value of 0.85. He tests with a significance level
(alpha) of 0.05. What is the correct conclusion based on this Chi-square
test?

Answerlist
----------
* Female students are significantly more likely to be members of Facebook
  than male students.
* Female students are not significantly more likely to be members of
  Facebook than male students.
* For the group of women there is a significant link between gender and
  Facebook membership, while for the group of men there is none
  significant relationship between these two variables.
* The above data provide too little information to come te a conclusion.

Solution
========





The chi square is lower than the critical value (see table).
