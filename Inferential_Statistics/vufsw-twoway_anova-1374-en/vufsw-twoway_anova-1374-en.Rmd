Question
========
Does your taste in music change as you get older? Field expects so and
researches this by distinguishing two age groups in an experiment: young
adults under 40 and elderly people over 40 (variable: age). Both age
groups are randomly divided into three smaller groups, and these have to
listen to music by Fugazo, Abba, or Barf Grooks (variable: music). Each
participant evaluates the music on a scale of -100 to +100 (variable:
liking, a higher score means a higher liking).

The F value of 'music' has been omitted, as has the mean square. How
large is the F of 'music'?* Enter only  a number in two decimal places,
nothing else.*
