Question
========
  
Nightmares have a negative impact on school performance. In a study on the effect of students' sleep problems on learning outcomes, a researcher conducts an experiment. Through referrals from general practitioners, the researcher obtained a group of 60 students suffering from nightmares. The group is randomly divided into three groups:

- Group 1: Therapy involving learning to influence the course of the dream.
- Group 2: A therapy with bedtime relaxation exercises.
- Group 3: Control.

For one week (7 nights), all participants count the number of times per night they wake up from a nightmare. The progression over time of the number of nightmares can thus be analyzed for the three groups.

What analysis technique can the researcher use to best determine whether the course of the number of nightmares per night differs between the groups?
