Question
========
  
A researcher wants to investigate if UCU students differ from Dutch university students in general with regard to the level of academic stress they experience (measured on a scale from 0 to 100). The researcher knows that the average stress score among students in the Netherlands is 59. For her study, the researcher has collected data from a random sample of 36 UCU students. The mean of the academic stress score in the sample was 62 and the estimated population variance (S2) was 100.


At a significance level of $\alpha$ = .05, should the researcher reject the null hypothesis?

  
Answerlist
----------
* She should not reject H0, since the results indicate a significant difference in stress levels.
* She should reject H0, since the results indicate a significant difference in stress levels.
* She should not reject H0 since the results indicate no significant difference in stress levels.
* She should reject H0, since the results indicate no significant difference in stress levels.
