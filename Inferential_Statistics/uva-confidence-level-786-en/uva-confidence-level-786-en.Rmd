The average of the difference scores (before -- after) is $\bar{x}_{d}$
= 5 and the standard deviation of the difference scores S~d~ = 0.82. Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the difference between the population averages of the participants before and after using Koburol._____________________. \ The 95% confidence interval for the difference between the population averages is
