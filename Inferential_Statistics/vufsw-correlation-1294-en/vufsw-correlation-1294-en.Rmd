The above covariance/correlation matrix lacks the correlation between
the degree to which a student scores high on the personality
characteristic 'Openness' (StudentO: openness) and the desired degree of
openness among his teachers (LecturO). The example is from a study by
Chamorro-Premuzic, described in Field (Discovering statistics using IBM
SPSS statistics, 2018) p. 365.  
  
What is the correlation? Give a number in two decimal places, nothing
else.
