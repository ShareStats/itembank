Question
========
A student at the VU studied the use of social media among Dutch people.
For her thesis, she collected data on the use of Instagram from 297
people. In the table at the bottom of the question, the age category
('jaar'= age) of the respondents is plotted according to whether they
have an Instagram account (actual observed count; 'Ja'=yes and 'Nee'
=no)).  
  
Based on the data in this table, what is the expected value ('expected
count') of the number of people in the youngest age group (15-19 years)
who have an Instagram account when the two variables are independent?
(Round to two decimal places)
