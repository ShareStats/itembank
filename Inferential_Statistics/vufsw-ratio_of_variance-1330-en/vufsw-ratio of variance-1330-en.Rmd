Question
========
Field claims that there has been an increase in muscle injuries as a due to playing Nintendo's Wii computer game. A researcher expects that people who play sports are less affected by this suffer from this because they are already accustomed to exercise. For those non-athletes, she expects that a warm-up prior to a Wii session will help prevent these injuries.  
  
To investigate this, she selects 120 athletes and 120 non-athletes ('athlete' - yes(1)/no(0)). Within each of the two groups, the participants were then randomly assigned to two groups: half had to do a 5-minute stretching (warm-up), and the other half did not (variable 'stretch' - yes(1)/no(0)). In all participants, after after the 4-hour Wii session, pain symptoms were measured on a scale of 1-10 ('injury'; 0 = no pain, 10 = strong pain).  
  
Below are the results of the analysis.

The "variance ratio" is a way of examining the assumption of the homogeneity of variances. In this study, 3 is the limit for how many times larger the largest within-group variance may be relative to the smallest within-group variance.  
  
* Variance ratio = largest 'within-group variance'/ smallest 'within-group variance'**  According to the 'variance ratio', is the assumption of homogeneity of variances met?

Answerlist
----------
* The variance ratio is less than 3, therefore we cannot assume an equal within-group variance between the groups
* The variance ratio is smaller than 3, therefore we can assume an equal 'within-group' variance between the groups
* The variance ratio is greater than 3, therefore we cannot assume an equal 'within-group' variance between the groups
* The variance ratio is greater than 3, therefore we can assume an equal 'within-group' variance between the groups
