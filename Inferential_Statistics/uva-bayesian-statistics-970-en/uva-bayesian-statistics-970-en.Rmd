Question
========

Suppose it is known that a proportion of 0.002 of Dutch women have disease *D*. There is a test to detect this disease. That test is not always reliable: in 0.04 of the cases in which the affected person has the disease, the test gives the result of no disease. 0.96 of those affected are detected with a positive result. Further : 0.96 of those who do not have the disease get a negative (no disease) result. Marja is told that she has a positive test result.

Set the events:

* *D* = The disease *D*,
* *P* = The positive test result.

Then what is the probability P(*D* and *P*)?
