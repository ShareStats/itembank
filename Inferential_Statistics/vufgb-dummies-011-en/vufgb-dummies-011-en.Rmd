Question
========

In an ANCOVA model with interaction, the following regression equation is estimated, where $x_{1}$ is the covariate and *z* is the Factor with two levels (dummy variable): $\hat{y} = 10+2x_{1}+3z-4x_{1}z$.

Calculate the predicted *y* score for a score 5 on the covariate and a score 1 on the dummy variable. 
Answerlist
----------
* 3
* 17
* 19
* 43

Solution
========

Enter $x_{1} = 5$ and $z = 1$ gives:

Predicted $y = 10+2 \times 5+3 \times 1-4 \times 5 \times 1 = 10+10+3-20 = 3$.
