Question
========

Given is a table of correlations for three predictors *x*1, *x*2 and *x*3.

  ------ ------ ------ *x*1 *x*2 *x*3 *x*1 *x*2 0.01 *x*3 0.35 0.05 ------ ------ ------

The regression equation for the dependent variable *y* is with only *x*1 and *x*3:â€ .
* *y* = 23.13 + 12.17 *x*1 + 2.10 *x*3. Now suppose the model is calculated with *x*2 added. Then the coefficient
