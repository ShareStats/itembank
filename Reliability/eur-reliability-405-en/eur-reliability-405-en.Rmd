Question
========
A researcher working at the psychology institute investigates alcohol abuse among adolescents. The researcher designed 34 statements the adolescents can agree or disagree with on a four-point scale (1 = completely agree; 2 = somewhat agree; 3 = somewhat disagree; 4 = completely disagree). An example of a statement is: When I feel lonely, I enjoy drinking an alcoholic beverage. The answers of 312 girls (0) and boys (1) to the 34 statements are in the dataset.

Conduct a reliability analysis. What is the scale variance when all the items are included? (3 decimals)
