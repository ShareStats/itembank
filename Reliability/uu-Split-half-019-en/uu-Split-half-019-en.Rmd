Question
========
We all know people we call "lucky people. Those can do whatever they want and they are always successful. On the other hand, we know the "unlucky ones. No matter what they undertake, it always goes wrong, never does anything decent come about.

In a pilot to develop a "luck or bad luck" scale, 17 statements (with five ordered response categories: 1 = totally agree to 5 = totally disagree) were presented to a random sample of 129 adults. The split-half method was used to estimate the reliability of the scale scores.

A disadvantage of estimating reliability using the split-half method is that the result: 

Answerlist
----------
* Gives an overestimate of the reliability coefficient.
* Gives a non-valid estimate of the reliability coefficient.
* Can only be used as an estimate for dichotomous items.
* Depends on the composition of the two halves.
