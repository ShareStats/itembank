Question
========
We are all familiar with people we call ‘lucky individuals.’ They seem to succeed in everything they do, no matter the circumstances. On the other hand, we also know ‘unlucky individuals’—no matter what they attempt, things always seem to go wrong, and nothing substantial ever comes of their efforts.

As part of a pilot study for developing a ‘luck or misfortune’ scale, 17 statements (with five ordered response categories: 1 = strongly agree to 5 = strongly disagree) were presented to a random sample of 129 adults. To estimate the reliability of the scale scores, the split-half method was used.

A drawback of estimating reliability using the split-half method is that the result:

Answerlist
----------
* Overestimates the reliability coefficient.
* Provides an invalid estimate of the reliability coefficient.
* Can only be used as an estimate for dichotomous items.
* Is dependent on how the two halves are composed.
