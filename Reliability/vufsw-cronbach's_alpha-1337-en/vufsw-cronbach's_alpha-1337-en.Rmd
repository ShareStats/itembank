Above is the correlation matrix of a number of items that all measure
attitude toward reading. Respondents had to indicate for each item
whether they completely disagreed, disagreed, agreed, or completely
agreed.  
  
The Cronbach's alpha of this scale based on these items is low, .097.
What is the next step in constructing a scale from these items?

Answerlist
