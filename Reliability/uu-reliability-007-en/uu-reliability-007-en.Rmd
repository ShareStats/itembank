Question
========
  
Classical test theory is based on a thought experiment in which the same test is administered an infinite number of times to the same respondent under identical conditions (replications).

For these replications of a respondent, it holds that:
  
Answerlist
----------
* The test scores remain the same, and the measurement error varies.
* The test scores differ, and the measurement error remains the same.
* The true score remains the same, and the measurement error varies.
* The true score varies, and the measurement error remains the same.

Solution
========
  
In classical test theory, it is assumed that a respondent in the thought experiment always has the same true score (X). However, their observed test score (T) will fluctuate, which means that the measurement error (e) also varies.
