Classical test theory is based on a thought experiment in which the same test is administered infinitely many times to the same respondent under similar conditions (replications).

For a respondent's replications, then: 
Answerlist
----------
* The test scores remain the same and the measurement error varies.
* The test scores vary and the measurement error remains the same.
* The true score stays the same and the measurement error varies.
* The true score varies and the measurement error remains the same.	


Solution
========
  
Test theory states that a respondent in the thought experiment will always have the same true score (X). However, his score on the test (T) will vary, which means that the measurement error also varies (e). The correct combination is given in answer option C.
