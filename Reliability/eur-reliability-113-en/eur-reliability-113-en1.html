<h4>Question</h4>

<p>The “Three Minutes Test” (TMT) is a test to assess technical reading level. Children have to accurately read as many words as possible during three minutes. A teacher from grade 5 wants to use the test, which was constructed for children in grade 2, to assess the reading skills of her grade 5 children.
Cronbach’s alpha based on the grade 2 population is .88 and the standard deviation of the test scores in grade 2 is 3.</p>
<p>Explain why the TMT will probably be less reliably for the children in grade 5.</p>
<br/>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>The TMT will probably be less reliably for the children in grade 5 because the variation in true scores is expected to be smaller. Since it is assumed from classical test theory that the error variance is equal for children in grade 2 and grade 4, the reliability will be lower in a population with less true score variance.</p>
