Question
========
Imagine the following two scenario's:

- You have two different, yet parallel tests that measure the same construct, with each test consisting of 8 items. You calculate an alternate forms estimate of the test's reliability (correlation between alternate forms of a test).
- You have one test consisting of 16 items. You calculate the split-half estimate of the reliability of the test.

Explain why the (split‐half) estimate of the reliability of the 16-item scale is higher than the (alternate forms) estimate of the reliability of the 8 item scale.


Solution
========
The (split‐half) estimate of the reliability of the 16 item scale is higher than the (alternate forms) estimate of the reliability of the 8 item scale because of its longer test length. In general: the more measurements one takes of a single construct, the higher the reliability of the (average) measurement will be. If everything else remains the same a scale score that is based on 16 items is more reliable than a scale score based on 8 items.
