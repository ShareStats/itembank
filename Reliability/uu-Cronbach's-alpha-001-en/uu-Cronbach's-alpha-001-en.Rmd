Question
========
The SPSS output below for the reliability analysis of the Negative Fear of Failure scale is based on data from the Performance Motivation Test for Children (PMTK).
If you had to shorten the test, which of the four listed items would be the least suitable to remove from the scale?

Answerlist
----------
* Item 1
* Item 5
* Item 11
* Item 14

Solution
========
  
This question can be approached in two ways: based on the item-rest correlation and based on Cronbach’s Alpha if item deleted.
- Item-rest correlation: The higher the item-rest correlation (column: Corrected Item-Total Correlation), the better an item fits the scale. An item is therefore the least suitable for removal if it has the highest item-rest correlation (which points to item 11, r = .61).
- Cronbach’s Alpha if item deleted: In this column, Cronbach’s Alpha is provided if the respective item is removed from the scale. Since the goal is to have the highest possible Cronbach’s Alpha, an item is the least suitable for removal when removing it results in the lowest alpha (which points to item 11, alpha = .829).
