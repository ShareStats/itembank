Question
========
  
A test for measuring the extent to which researchers honor scientific integrity consists of twenty items. The test has a reliability rXX' = .50. This is rated by the Cotan as inadequate. Desirable is an estimated reliability of at least .70. It is decided to extend the test by five equivalent items.

Does this extension realize an expected test score reliability (rXX') of .70?

  
Answerlist
----------
* Yes, the estimated reliability is then: rXX' ≥ .85
* Yes, the estimated reliability is then: .85 > rXX ≥ .70
* No, the estimated reliability is then: .70 > rXX' ≥ .60
* No, the estimated reliability is then: rXX' < .60
