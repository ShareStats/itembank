Question
========
  
A test for measuring the extent to which researchers uphold scientific integrity consists of twenty items. The test has a reliability of rXX’ = .50. DThis is assessed as insufficient by Cotan. A minimum estimated reliability of .70 is desired. The decision is made to extend the test with five equivalent items.

Does this extension achieve the expected reliability of the test scores (rXX’) van .70?

  
Answerlist
----------
* Yes, the estimated reliability is then:  rXX’  ≥ .85
* Yes, the estimated reliability is then: .85  > rXX ≥  .70
* No, the estimated reliability is then: .70  > rXX’   ≥  .60
* No, the estimated reliability is then: rXX’  <  .60
