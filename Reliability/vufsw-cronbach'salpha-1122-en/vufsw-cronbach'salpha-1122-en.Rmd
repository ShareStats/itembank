Question
========
For his thesis research, a graduate student measured the degree of
self-confidence of students with a scale consisting of 6 items ranging
from 1 (low self-confidence) to 10 (high self-confidence). The
Cronbach's alpha of this scale is 0.74.  
  
  
The Cronbach's alpha could be increased by:  
  
  
I.             Adding another item to the scale.  
II.            Removing an item with a low corrected item-total
correlation.  
III.           Remove from the scale an item with a value of 0.79 in
"Cronbach's alpha if item deleted".
