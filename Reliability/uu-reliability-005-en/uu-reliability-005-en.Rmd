Question
========
  
In an experiment on sensitivity to environmental noise during cognitive task performance, participants are given ten problems. The reliability coefficient rXXâ€™ of this test (calculated over the total score of the ten problems) is 0.60. A researcher decides to extend the test by adding five equivalent problems.

The estimated reliability of the extended test (rvv') is:


Answerlist
----------
* rvv' is less than or equal to 0.60
* rvv' is greater than 0.60 but less than or equal to 0.70
* rvv' is greater than 0.70 but less than or equal to 0.80
* rvv' is greater than 0.80

Solution
========
  
First, we determine the extension factor:

$v= \frac {k'}{k} = \frac {Nieuwe aantal items} {Oorspronkelijk aantal items} = \frac {15}{10} = 1.50$

We know that the original test reliability was 0.60. Using the Spearman-Brown formula, we calculate the estimated reliability of the extended test:

$r_{vv'} = \frac {v * r_{oo'}} {1 + (v-1)r{oo'}} = \frac {1.50 * 0.60}  {1+ (1.50-1) * 0.60} = \frac {0.90}{1.30} = 0.69 $
  
Thus, the correct answer is: rvv' is greater than 0.60 but less than or equal to 0.70.
