Question
========
  
The Media & Entertainment Management (MEM) program at Inholland University of Applied Sciences was rated very weak by the Dutch Education Inspectorate in 2011. Following this report, a study is conducted to assess student satisfaction with the program. An experimental test version consists of 20 equivalent items and has a reliability coefficient rxx' of 0.85. However, for the actual study, the researcher needs to shorten the test by removing five items.

The estimated reliability of the scores for the shortened test (r Ì‚VV') is then: 


Answerlist
----------
* Lower than 0.65
* Between 0.65 and 0.75
* Between 0.75 and 0.85
* Higher than 0.85

Solution
========

Explanation: The formula for the scaling factor is:
v - $\frac {k'}{k}$ where: k' is the number of items in the new test (20 - 5 = 15 items) and k is the number of items in the original test (20 items)
Substituting the values: v= $\frac {15}{20}= 0.75$

The formula for the estimated reliability of the shortened test is: $r_{xx'} = \frac {0.75 * 0.85}{1+ (0.75-1) 0.85} =  \frac {0.6375}{1+ -0.2125} = \frac {0.6375}{0.7875} = 0.809  $
  
Thus, the correct answer is: "Between 0.75 and 0.85" (Option C).
