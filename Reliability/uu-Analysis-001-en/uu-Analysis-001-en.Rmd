Which item(s) would you like to remove in the next step of this analysis? And why? 
Answerlist
----------
* Item 10 because the dispersion (variance) becomes smallest if you remove this item.
* Items 6 and 7 because the item-rest correlations are too small.
* Items 6 and 7 because Cronbach's alpha increases when you remove these items.
* Item 6 because Cronbach's alpha increases if you remove this item and because this item-rest correlation is smallest.
