Question
========
  
For passing the theory driving exam, some learning styles are more successful than others. In research on the influence of learning styles on exam results, a separate test has been developed for each learning style. Two test developers talk to each other about the meaning of measurement error $E$ within classical test theory.

Evaluate the following two statements:

I. The measurement error E of a test does not correlate ($r_{ET} = 0$) with the true score $T$. II. Between the measurement errors $E$ of the tests for the different learning styles is not consistent.

  
Answerlist
----------
* Pronunciation I and II are both correct.
* Only pronunciation I is correct.
* Only pronunciation II is correct.
* Pronunciation I and II are both incorrect.


Solution
========
Theorem 1: According to classical test theory, measurement error is $E$ independent of the true score $T$, because $E$ is an accidental and unsystematic measurement error.

Theorem 2: Measurement error $E$ is accidental and unsystematic; there is no consistency among them.
