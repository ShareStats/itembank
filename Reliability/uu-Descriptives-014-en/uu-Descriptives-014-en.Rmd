Question
========
  
For passing the theoretical driving exam, one learning style is more successful than another. In a study on the influence of learning styles on exam results, a separate test was developed for each learning style. Two test developers discuss the meaning of measurement error $E$ within classical test theory.

Evaluate the following two statements:

I.	I. The measurement error $E$ of a test does not correlate ($r_{ET} = 0$) with the true score $T$.
II. There is no relationship between the measurement errors $E$ of the tests for the different learning styles.



  
Answerlist
----------
* Statement I and II are both correct.
* Only statement I is correct.
* Only statement II is correct.
* Statement I and II are both incorrect.


Solution
========
Statement 1: According to classical test theory, measurement error $E$ is independent of the true score $T$ because $E$ is a random and unsystematic measurement error.

Statement 2: Measurement error $E$ is random and unsystematic, meaning there is no relationship between them.
