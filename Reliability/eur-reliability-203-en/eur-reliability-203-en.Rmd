Question
========
A researcher at the department of education, psychology and child studies developed a test to measure anxiety in children with different ethnic backgrounds. The aim of the test is in particular to measure differences in anxiety between groups of children. What does this aim mean for the required reliability of the test?

Answerlist
----------
* The reliability has to be about the same as the reliability required for testing individuals.
* The reliability is allowed to be a bit lower than for testing individuals.
* The reliability has to be a bit higher than for testing individuals
* The required reliability depends on the variation in the anxiety scores of the children.


Solution
========
Because the reliability of an average does depend both on the reliability and the sample size, the reliability of a test that is used to compare group averages is allowed to be a bit lower. The sample size compensates for the lower test reliability rendering the average still reliable.

Answerlist
----------
* False
* True
* False
* False
