Question
========
In *de Volkskrant (Dutch newspaper)*, an article entitled "Too good to
be true" was published on 21 January 2012 about the unmasking of the
Tilburg professor of social psychology Diederik Stapel by three young
researchers. In this article one of them, Jesse, speaks. He describes
the research he did under the supervision of Stapel. The following two
exam questions consist of filling out omitted text and numbers from this
section of this newspaper article.

<td>Stapel would have the research carried out in three different
experiments at his famous schools. Less than a month later, Jesse had
the results. "Everything we had predicted in our hypothesis had come
true. And it was a big effect too. I thought: such nice results, that
simply cannot. It never happens to me. "<br />
<br />
Jesse decided to look for a number that scientists call 'Cronbach's
alpha'. That number is a measure that, simply put, indicates whether the
answers to a completed questionnaire are [-- text 1--]. Someone who
answers the question 'Are you afraid of spinning?' with 'Yes' has to
answer the question 'Do you ever have to be afraid of something' also
with 'yes' and it is precisely that [--text 2--] that measures the
number alpha.<br />
<br />
The outcome was shocking. "Normally you would expect an alpha greater
than [- number X--] in this study," Jesse explains. 'With an alpha lower
than [- number Y--] something unacceptable is going on. And the alpha of
Stapel was really ridiculously low: smaller than [- number Z--]. This
can almost only indicate that the questionnaires were randomly filled
in. '<br />
<br />
It was January 2011, and Jesse had for the first time a concrete
indication that the celebrated and popular professor and dean deceived
the whole. "It was the only time I could not sleep," he says.<br />
