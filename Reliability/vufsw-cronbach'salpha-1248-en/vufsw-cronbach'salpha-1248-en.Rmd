<img src="1645518804011.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii tvcss_2"
alt="1645518804011" />  
  
From which measurement instrument will the internal consistency of the
scale (the Cronbach's alpha) be higher?

Answerlist
----------
*   
  The Cronbach's alpha from measurement instrument 1 is higher.
* The Cronbach's alpha from measurement instrument 2 is higher.
* The Cronbach's alpha's of both measurement instruments are equally high.
* Based on this information it is not possible to determine which
  Cronbach's alpha is higher.

Solution
========





The Cronbach's alpha from instrument 1 is higher. Because the items are
higher correlated.
