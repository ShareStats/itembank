Question
========
A researcher conducted a regression analysis to predict a person's
interest in politics (Y) based on how often a person reads news articles
(X) per week. Political interest was measured using a scale ranging from
1 ('not at all interested') to 10 ('very interested'). The formula
associated with the regression line is at the bottom of the question.  
  
For the measurement of political interest, the researcher has developed
a scale consisting of 10 items. She wants to know whether this is a
reliable scale. She finds that in a random sample of 231 respondents,
the average correlation between the items is 0.512. If we assume that
the variances of the 10 items are the same, how high is the Cronbach's
Alpha?Â
