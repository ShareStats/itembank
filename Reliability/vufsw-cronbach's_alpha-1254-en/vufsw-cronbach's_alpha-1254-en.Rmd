Question
========
For his thesis research, a graduate student measured the degree of
self-confidence of students with a scale consisting of 6 items, whereby
the answer categories are ranging from 1 (little self-confidence) to 10
(a lot of self-confidence). The Cronbach's alpha of this scale is
0.68.  
  
How could the Cronbach's alpha be increased?

Answerlist
----------
* Add an additional item to the scale.
* Remove an item with a high corrected item-total correlation.
* Remove an item with a value of 0.65 for "Cronbach's alpha if Item
  Deleted".
* Recode all the answer categories of items, so that 1 means "a lot of
  self-confidence" and 10 means "little self-confidence".

Solution
========
