Question
========
  
A new test is designed to measure parents' motivation to actively participate in school activities. A pilot study is conducted to assess the practical usability and psychometric quality of the test, which consists of 40 Likert items. However, the test appears to be too long; a significant portion of participants randomly selects answers towards the end rather than responding thoughtfully.

As a result, in this pilot study, the estimated reliability of the test scores...
  
Answerlist
----------
* ...remains unchanged. With a length of 40 questions, the reliability of the test scores is not affected.
* ...is overestimated, because the final items were not truthfully completed.
* ...is underestimated, because the responses to the final items do not correlate with one another.
* This cannot be determined based on the given information.



Solution
========
  
The final items are not necessarily answered incorrectly (as participants might accidentally select the "correct" response). However, these items do not correlate with each other or with the rest of the test. Reliability measures the consistency of responses across items. Since the final items were answered inconsistently, the reliability estimate will be underestimated.
