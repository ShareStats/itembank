Question
========
  
Prof. A. James is analyzing a survey. One of the scales consists of 8 questions. When she conducts a reliability analysis, she finds a Cronbachâ€™s alpha of $0.455$. Part of the SPSS output is shown below.

Based on these results, Prof. A. James decides not to remove any items from this scale. She provides two arguments for this decision:

I. Removing items risks compromising internal validity.
II. Since the scale consists of only 8 items, on average, the scale with all 8 items will be more reliable than a scale with only 7 or even 6 items.

  
Answerlist
----------
* Both statements are correct
* Only statement I is correct
* Only statement II is correct
* Neither statement is correct
