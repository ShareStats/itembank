Question
========
  
Prof. A. James is analyzing a survey. One of the scales has 8 questions. When she performs a reliability analysis she finds a Cronbach's alpha of $0.455$. Below is part of the SPSS output.

Based on these data, Prof. A. James decides not to remove items from this scale. She gives two arguments for this:

I. Removing items creates the danger of affecting internal validity. II. Because the scale consists of only 8 items, the scale with all 8 items will be more reliable on average than a scale with only 7 or even only 6 items.


  
Answerlist
----------
* Both statements are correct
