Question
========
How is it possible that although alpha places a lower limit on the size of the estimated reliability, in practice it is possible to get an alpha that is higher than the true reliability?


Solution
========
It is possible that although alpha places a lower limit on the size of the estimated reliability, in practice one gets an alpha that is higher than the true reliability. This is because the alpha is calculated using a sample, and not the complete population. So the sample alpha may be large (even larger than the true reliability $r_{xx'}$) due to sampling variability.
