Question
========
  
In Vedic education, transcendental meditation plays an important role. Through meditation techniques, students' consciousness is expanded. In a questionnaire study of the effect of meditation on consciousness, an existing test with six items and a reliability rxx' = .50 is extended by three equivalent items.

How high do you estimate the reliability of the extended test V for consciousness?

  
Answerlist
----------
* Rvv'is approximately .50
* Rvv'is approximately .60
* Rvv'is approximately .70
* Rvv'is approximately .75

Solution
========

Explanation: The new test is 9 items long (6+3=9). The extension factor is 1.5 (9/6=1.5). The reliability of this manygde test is calculated using the following formula: 

$r_{xx'} = \frac {v * r_{oo'}}{1+ (v-1) r_{oo'}} $

Filling in gives:

$r_{xx'} = \frac {1.5 * 50}{1+ (1.5-1) 0.50} =  \frac {0.75}{1+ 0.25} = \frac {0.75}{1.25} = 0.60  $
