Question
========
  
In Vedic education, transcendental meditation plays a crucial role. Through meditation techniques, students expand their consciousness. A survey study is conducted to examine the effect of meditation on consciousness, using an existing test with six items and a reliability coefficient of rxx' = .50. The test is then extended with three equivalent items.

What is the estimated reliability of the extended test (V) for consciousness?


  
Answerlist
----------
* rvv'is approximately 0.50
* rvv'is approximately .60
* rvv'is approximately .70
* rvv'is approximately .75

Solution
========

Explanation:
The new test consists of 9 items (6 + 3 = 9). The scaling factor is calculated as: 1.5 (9/6=1.5). The reliability of the extended test is estimated using the Spearman-Brown formula:

$r_{xx'} = \frac {v * r_{oo'}}{1+ (v-1) r_{oo'}} $

Substituting the values:

$r_{xx'} = \frac {1.5 * 50}{1+ (1.5-1) 0.50} =  \frac {0.75}{1+ 0.25} = \frac {0.75}{1.25} = 0.60  $
  
Thus, the correct answer is: rvv'is approximately .60
