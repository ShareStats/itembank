Question
========
*Work for psychologists and pedagogues.*

A researcher has been tasked with investigating whether graduated psychologists and pedagogues are able to find a job at their level. To do this, the researcher has designed a questionnaire consisting of 12 Likert items with 5 response options ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5). One example of an item is: "I had to make a lot of effort to find a job vacancy at my level." The responses of 608 pedagogues and psychologists to the twelve items are displayed in the dataset, with the variable [psy_ped] distinguishing pedagogues (1) and psychologists (2). Note: The total score across the 12 items indicates how difficult someone finds it to find a job at their level. The higher the total score, the more difficult they find it to find a job at their level.
