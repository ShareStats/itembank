Question
========
Exams aim at measuring a person's true score. The accuracy of this measurement of the true score will likely be lower if the reliability of the test is too low. One way to theoretically compensate for this lower accuracy is by calculating the adjusted true score: $X_{est} = x̄ + R_{xx}(X_o-x̄)$

Students doing the exam on psychometrics need a 6.0 the pass at the exam. One student has a 6.0. The average score is 5.8 and the reliability of the exam is .31. Do you advise this student to complain about the reliability of the exam? Explain why.


Solution
========
The adjusted true score (estimated true score) for a student having an observed score of 6 is:
$X_{adj} = 5.8 + .31(6.0 - 5.8)$
$X_{adj} = 5.8 + .062 = 5.862 = 5.9$

The estimated score is 5.9, which is below the criterion. So in this case the student can better be happy with the lower reliability
