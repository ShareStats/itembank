<h4>Question</h4>

<p>A researcher wants to investigate if UCU students differ from Dutch university students in general with regard to the level of academic stress they experience (measured on a scale from 0 to 100). The researcher knows that the average stress score among students in the Netherlands is 59. For her study, the researcher has collected data from a random sample of 36 UCU students. The mean of the academic stress score in the sample was 62 and the estimated population variance (S2) was 100.</p>
<p>What are the research hypothesis (HR) and the null hypothesis (H0) of this study?</p>
<br/>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<b>FALSE:</b> HR: There is no difference in stress levels between UCU students and Dutch students in general.H0: There is a difference in stress levels between UCU students and Dutch students in general.
</li>
<li>
<b>FALSE:</b> HR: UCU students experience higher levels of academic stress than Dutch students in general. H0: There is no difference in stress levels between UCU students and Dutch students in general.
</li>
<li>
<b>TRUE:</b> HR: There is a difference in stress levels between UCU students and Dutch students in general.H0: There is no difference in stress levels between UCU students and Dutch students in general.
</li>
<li>
<b>FALSE:</b> HR: UCU students experience higher levels of academic stress than Dutch students in general.H0: UCU students do not experience higher levels of academic stress than Dutch students in general.
