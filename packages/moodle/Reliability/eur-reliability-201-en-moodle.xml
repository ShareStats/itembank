<text><![CDATA[<p>
<p>Relatively many easy items means that the test is relatively easy that is suited for people with low ability: it discriminates well between low ability scores. Since high ability people will give correct answers to most of the easy questions the test does not discriminate well between high ability scores. So the test is more reliable for low ability than for high ability level.</p>
