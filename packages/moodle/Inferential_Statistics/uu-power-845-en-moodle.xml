<p>We are interested in evaluating the effect of a natural product on reducing blood pressure. This is done by comparing the mean reduction in blood pressure of a treatment (natural product) group and a placebo group using a two-sample t test. The standard deviations are approximately the same, so the researchers will use an independent samples t test, and based on previous work the researchers are able to specify a common sample standard deviation. The researchers have specified <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{1}\)</span> - $<span class="math inline">\(mu_{2}\)</span> = 7 as an alternative they would like to be able to detect with a significance level of 1%. Sample sizes of 50 in each group are selected and found to have a power of 80%. If the researchers now decide they are interested in the alternative <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{1}\)</span> - <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{2}\)</span> = 5 instead, how would the power of the study for this alternative compare to the previous one?</p>
