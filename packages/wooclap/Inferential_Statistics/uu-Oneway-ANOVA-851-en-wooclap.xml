<p>Four education science students conduct a study for the bachelorâ€™s thesis on the effects of concept mapping on learning performance of psychology students (N = 86). The study distinguishes three conditions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Pure: Students receiving instruction in concept mapping. 2. Supportive: Students receiving instruction in creating the concept map, with part of the concept map already given. 3. Control: Students who do not receive instruction in creating the concept map.</li>
</ol>
<p>Four weeks after the psychology students read the chapter, they take a knowledge test (ten questions where each correct answer earns 1 point). Students in experimental conditions 1 and 2 are expected to score higher on average on the knowledge test than students in the control condition.</p>
<p>The education science students analyze the data with an ANOVA. They note the following data from this in their report:
<span class="math inline">\(F(2, 83) = 17.90\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\eta^2 = 0.13\)</span>.</p>
<p>Which of the following statements is correct based on the reported test result?</p>

<p>This study compares 3 different conditions. Finding a significant difference between these groups (p &lt; .001), we do not yet know which of the 3 groups differ from each other. This requires a post hoc analysis.</p>
