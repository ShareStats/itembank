<p>An educational scientist is investigating how mind mapping influences learning among UCU-students. In this research three conditions are present:</p>
<p>I. Pure: Students receive instructions while making a mind map
II. Support: Students are shown part of a mind map as an example and receive instructions while making their mind map,
III. Control: Students do not get any instruction while making a mind map
The next week the students take a knowledge test. The researcher expects that the students in the Pure (I) and Support (II) conditions score higher on the knowledge test than the students in the control condition (III).
The researcher analyses the data with an ANOVA. He writes in the research report:
F(2, 83) = 17.90, p &lt; .001, Î·2 = .131.
Which of the following statements is correct given the reported results?</p>
