<p>A researcher wants to investigate if UCU students differ from Dutch university students in general with regard to the level of academic stress they experience (measured on a scale from 0 to 100). The researcher knows that the average stress score among students in the Netherlands is 59. For her study, the researcher has collected data from a random sample of 36 UCU students. The mean of the academic stress score in the sample was 62 and the estimated population variance (S2) was 100.</p>
<p>What are the research hypothesis (HR) and the null hypothesis (H0) of this study?</p>
