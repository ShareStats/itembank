<p>A number of researchers feel that more practice with statistics tasks increases the volume of the brain area involved makes. To that end, they conduct a study and measure the volume of the brain area when subjects spend (1) 3 hours or (2) 6 hours practicing doing statistics problems. The average volume of the involved brain area of 31 subjects at 3 hours of practice was 3.2 and the standard deviation 2.1; the mean volume of 31 subjects at 6 hours of exercise was 5.2 with standard deviation 4. The null hypothesis that the researchers are testing is that there is no difference in the population averages between the two groups. This null hypothesis is tested against the alternative hypothesis that the mean of the group who had practiced 3 hours is smaller than that of the group who had practiced 6 hours practiced. It is not assumed that the standard deviations of the respective populations are equal, and testing is done with 60 degrees of freedom.Ê  The P-value associated with these data is</p>
