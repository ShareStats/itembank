Question
========
We analyze whether students' performance differs between 3 subjects: literature, essay writing and mathematics (they are listed in this order in the dataset). In addition, we examine whether any differences between the 3 subjects vary between male and female schoolchildren. Therefore, we use a Mixed Design ANOVA. The output of this analysis is shown below. "**Female**" is coded as 0: male, 1: female.  
Has the assumption of homogeneity of variances been violated (see output below)?
