Question
========
What assumption must be observed when using used of a MANOVA?

Answerlist
----------
* Homogeneity of variances
* Sphericity
* Homogeneity of variances and sphericity
* Homogeneity of covariance matrices

Solution
========

In one-way ANOVA, the variances of the residuals must be equal for all groups of the independent variable. This is the homogeneity of variances assumption.  
In Repeated Measures ANOVA, the variances of the difference scores of the conditions must be equal. This is the assumption of Sphericity.  
A Mixed Design ANOVA is a combination of a between-groups design and a Repeated Measures design. Thus, the assumption of homogeneity of variances must hold for the between groups component and the assumption of Sphericity for the Repeated Measures component.  
In MANOVA, the variances of the residuals of each dependent variable and the covariances of all pairs of dependent variables must be equal for all groups of the independent variable. This is the assuption of Homogeneity of Covariance Matrices.
