Question
========
In a one-way repeated measures ANOVA, a researcher needs to test, amongst other assumptions, the sphericity assumption. Consider the following statements about the sphericity assumption and answer the subsequent question. 

1. This assumption does not apply when the within-subjects factor only has two levels. 

2. When this assumption is severely violated, a researcher can use a repeated-measures multivariate test (MANOVA) as an alternative to the uncorrected F-test. 

Which statement is true?

Answerlist
----------
* both statements are true
* only statement 1 is true
* only statement 2 is true
* both statements are false


Solution
========
Claim 1 is true because sphericity looks at whether the variances of the difference scores differ. In the case of 2 levels, there is only one difference score, so this assumption does not apply.

Claim 2 is also true because you can perform repeated measures with a MANOVA, but the assumption of sphericity is not required in this analysis.

Answerlist
----------
* True
* False
* False
* False
