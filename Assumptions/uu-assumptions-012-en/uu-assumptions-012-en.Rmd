Question
========
Which of the following statements about multiple linear regression analysis is/are correct?

I. Violating the assumption of homoscedasticity, some scores on an independent variable deviate significantly from the overall trend (outliers). II. Scatterplots can be used to assess by eye whether the assumption of linear relationships between variables is violated.

Answerlist
----------
* Both are correct
* I is correct, II is not correct
* I is not correct, II is correct
* I is not correct, II is not correct


Solution
========
Theorem I is incorrect The assumption of homoscedasticity implies that the distribution of residuals per X value is equal. When this assumption is violated, the distribution of residuals is not the same for all scores on the independent variable.

Theorem II is correct Using a scatterplot, we can judge by eye whether there is a linear relationship between X and Y.
