Question
========
Which condition of regression analysis did Marco verify with the graph below?

![](uu-normality-011-nl-tabel.jpg)

Answerlist
----------
* Linear relation
* Homoscedasticity
* Sphericity
* By X value, Y scores are normally distributed


Solution
========
With a histogram of the residuals, we can see whether, for each X value, the Y scores .

Answerlist
----------
* We can view the condition of linearity with a scatterplot.
* We can view the condition of homoscedasticity with a residuals plot.
* The condition of sphericity is not a condition for multiple regression, but for a repeated measures analysis, and can be viewed with Mauchly's test.
* This is the correct answer!
