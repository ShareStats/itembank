Question
========
You run a MANOVA with 3 dependent variables and equal group sizes for
the categories of the independent variable.  
  
There are 3 Levene's tests performed. If one of them is statistically
**\[--I--\]**, you can conclude that the assumption of 'equality of
covariance matrices' is **\[--II--\]**.

Answerlist
----------
* I. significant  
  II. violated
* I. significant  
  II. not violated
* I. significant  
  II. not possible to be tested
* I. insignificant  
  II. violated
* I. insignificant  
  II. not violated
* I. insignificant  
  II. not possible to be tested

Solution
========





In MANOVA there is one Levene's test performed for every dependent
variable. Therefore, there are 3 Levene's tests done in this case. If
one of them is statistically significant, this means that the variances
cannot be assumed equal across groups for one of the dependent
variables. Therefore, the assumption of the homogeneity of the
covariance matrices (which is another word for the equality of variances
and covariances) is violated.

----------
* True
* False
* False
* False
* False
* False
