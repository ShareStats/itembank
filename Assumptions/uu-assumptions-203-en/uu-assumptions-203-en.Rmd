Question
========
Which assumption(s) can you check with a scatterplot (of the X and Y variables)?

Answerlist
----------
* Linearity
* Outliers
* Homoscedasticity
* All of the above


Solution
========
Using a scatter plot, we can assess by eye whether there is a linear relationship between X and Y.
The assumption of homoscedasticity implies that the dispersion of residuals per X value is equal. When this assumption is violated, the dispersion of residuals is not equal for all scores on the independent variable.
In a scatter diagram, outliers are visible and can thus be identified.
