Question
========
What assumption(s) can you check with a scatterplot (scatter plot of the X and Y variables)?

Answerlist
----------
* Linearity
* Outliers
* Homoscedasticity
* All of the above


Solution
========
Using a scatterplot, we can assess by eye whether there is a linear relationship between X and Y. The assumption of homoscedasticity implies that the dispersion of residuals for each X value is equal. When this assumption is violated, the dispersion of residuals is not equal for all scores on the independent variable. In a scatterplot, outliers are visible and can thus be identifiediﬁed.
