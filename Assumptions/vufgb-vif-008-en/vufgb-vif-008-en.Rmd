Question
========

A researcher wants to know if there is extreme multicollinearity in her multiple linear regression with three predictors. The multiple correlation between $X_{1}$ and the other two predictors is 0.90. Calculate the VIF value for $X_{1}$.

Based on this VIF value, is there extreme multicollinearity? 
Answerlist
----------
* $VIF = 5.26$; though extreme multicollinearity
* $VIF = 5.26$; no extreme multicollinearity
* $VIF = 11.11$; no extreme multicollinearity
* $VIF = 11.11$; though extreme multicollinearity

Solution
========

Use formula $VIF = \frac{1}{(1-R_{j}^{2})} = \frac{1}{(1-0.90^{2})} = \frac{1}{0.19} = 5.26$. A VIF value of 10 or higher is considered extreme multicollinearity. Values higher than 2-5 are otherwise considered "potentially problematic.
