Question
========

A researcher wants to know whether there is extreme multicollinearity in her multiple linear regression with three predictors. The multiple correlation between $X_{1}$ and the other two predictors is 0.90. Calculate the VIF value for $X_{1}$. 

Based on this VIF value, is there extreme multicollinearity?
  
Answerlist
----------
* $VIF = 5.26$; extreme multicollinearity present
* $VIF = 5.26$; extreme multicollinearity absent
* $VIF = 11.11$; extreme multicollinearity absent
* $VIF = 11.11$; extreme multicollinearity present 

Solution
========

Use formula $VIF = VIF = VIF{(1-R_{j}^{2})} = VIF = VIF{(1-0.90^{2})} = VIF = VIF = VIF {(1-R_{j}^{2})}{(1-0.90^{2})} = VIF = VIF{0.19} = 5.26$. A VIF value of 10 or higher is considered extreme multicollinearity. Values higher than 2-5 are otherwise seen as ‘potentially problematic’.
