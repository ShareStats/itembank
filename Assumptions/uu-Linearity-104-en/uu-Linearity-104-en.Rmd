Question
========
Which of the following conditions must be satisfied for a single regression analysis in which the score on Y is predicted from the score on X?

Answerlist
----------
* The relationship between X and Y must be linear
* The variable Y must be measured at least at ratio measurement level
* X must be approximately normally distributed
* All three conditions must be met

Solution
========
In a regression analysis, it is important that there is a linear relationship between X and Y. This is because it is a linear regression analysis. If there is no linear relationship, you cannot simply run this regression.
The answer ‘the variable Y must be measured at least at ratio measurement level’ is not correct, because X and/or Y may also be measured at interval measurement level.
The answer ‘X must be approximately normally distributed’ is not correct, because X need not be normally distributed, as long as the combination of X and Y is.

Answerlist
----------
* Right!
* This is incorrect
* This is incorrect
* This is incorrect
