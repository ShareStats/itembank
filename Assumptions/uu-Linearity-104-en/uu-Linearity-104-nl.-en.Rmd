Question
========
Which of the following conditions must be met for a single regression analysis in which the score on Y is predicted from the score on X?

Answerlist
----------
* The relationship between X and Y must be linear
* The variable Y must be measured at least at the ratio measurement level
* X must be approximately normally distributed
* All three conditions must be met


Solution
========
In a regression analysis, it is important that there is a linear relationship between X and Y. This is because it is a linear regression analysis. If there is no linear relationship, you cannot simply run this regression. The answer "the variable Y must be measured at least at the ratio measurement level" is not correct, because X and/or Y may also be measured at the interval measurement level. The answer "X must be approximately normally distributed" is not correct, because X need not be normally distributed, as long as the combination of X and Y is. You will get more explanation of this at MTS3.
