Question
========
Do your music tastes change as you get older? Field expects so and investigates this by distinguishing in an experiment two age groups young adults under 40 and older adults over 40. (variable: age). Both age groups are also randomly divided into three smaller groups, and these have to listen to music by Fugazo, Abba, or Barf Grooks (variable: music). Each participant rates the music on a scale of -100 to +100 (variable: liking; a higher score means higher "liking").

The "variance ratio" is a way of examining the assumption of the homogeneity of variances. In this study, 3 is the limit for how many times larger the largest within-group variance may be relative to the smallest within-group variance.  
  
* Variance ratio = largest 'within-group variance'/ smallest 'within-group variance'**  According to the 'variance ratio', is the assumption of homogeneity of variances met?

Answerlist
----------
* The variance ratio is about 2.6, smaller than 3, therefore we cannot assume equal within-group variance between the groups
* The variance ratio is about 2.6, smaller than 3, therefore we can assume equal 'within-group' variance between the groups
* The variance ratio is approximately 1.6, smaller than 3, therefore we cannot assume equal 'within-group' variance between the groups
* The variance ratio is about 1.6, smaller than 3, therefore we can assume equal within-group variance between the groups

Solution

----------
* False
