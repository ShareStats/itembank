Answerlist
----------
* The standardized slope (Beta) and correlation coefficient (*r*) are always are the same size at any value of x (linearity).
* The relationship between the dependent and independent variable is causal (causality).
* The conditional standard deviation of y (s<sub>res</sub>) for each value of x is identical (constant variance).
* The explained variance (R<sup>2</sup>) and the marginal variance are always are identical to each other (homogeneity).
