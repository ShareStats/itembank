Question
========
A study of internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors (X1 through X5) in rural youth resulted in the following correlation matrix:

![](uu-Communalities-006-nl-tabel.jpg)

The communality h2 of variable X5 (PSYCHOSOMATIC) is equal to .61.

Of which of the problem behaviors listed below is the explained variance of the two-factor solution higher?

Answerlist
----------
* X1 crime
* X2 vandalism
* X3 depression
* X4 eating disorders


Solution
========
Explanation: To calculate the explained variance of each variable, calculate the communality for each variable. To do this, the following formula is used:

$h^2_g = \sum a^2_{gt} ,$ This formula indicates that the communality of a variable is the sum of the quantized factor loadings. This is done below for the four variables:

$h^2_{x1criminaliteit} = .67^2 + .53^2 = .449+ .281 =.73$ 
$h^2_{x2vandalisme} = .63^2 + .17^2 = .397 + .004 = .40$
$h^2_{x3depressie} = .76^2 + -.13^2 = .578 + .017 =.60$
$h^2_{x4eetstoornissen} = .67^2 + -.21^2 = .449 + .044 = .49$
