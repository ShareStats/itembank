Question
========
What assumption should be taken into account when using a One-way ANOVA?

Answerlist
----------
* Homogeneity of variances
* Sphericity
* Homogeneity of variances en sphericity
* Homogeneity of covariance matrices

Solution
========





In one-way ANOVA, the variances of the residuals must be the same for
all groups of the independent variable. This is the homogeneity of
variances assumption.  
In Repeated Measures ANOVA, the variances of the difference scores of
the conditions must be equal. This is the assumption of Sphericity.  
A Mixed Design ANOVA is a combination of a between-groups design and a
Repeated Measures design. Thus, the assumption of homogeneity of
variances must apply to the between groups part and the assumption of
Sphericity to the Repeated Measures part.  
In MANOVA, the variances of the residuals of each dependent variable and
the covariances of all pairs of dependent variables must be the same for
all groups of the independent variable. This is the assuaging of
Homogeneity of Covariance Matrices.
