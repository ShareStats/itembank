Question
========
One of the conditions of a regression analysis is about "homoscedasticity." Which graph is best to use to check this condition?

Answerlist
----------
* A scatterplot with the predictors on the X-axis and nurse stress scores on the Y-axis
* A scatterplot with the residuals on the X-axis and nurse stress scores on the Y-axis
* A scatterplot with the residuals on the X axis and nurse stress scores on the Y axis
* A scatterplot with standardized-predicted nurse stress scores on the X-axis and the standardized residuals on the Y-axis


Solution
========
Homoscedasticity means that the spread in residuals for each X value is approximately equal. In other words, that the dispersion in residuals for each predicted value is about the same. You can check this condition with a scatterplot where you put the standardized predicted scores on the X-axis, and the standardized residuals on the Y-axis.
