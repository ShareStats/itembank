Question
========
There are quite a few deficiencies in children's sex education. A number of elementary school are now trying to break patterns and prevent sexual derailments. A prevention project Beauty and the beast is aimed at increasing the resilience of girls. The girls were given a questionnaire before, during and after the project that measured their resilience. Prior to testing whether resilience changed, one examines whether or not the assumption of sphericity was violated. The significance level at which the test is performed is 10%.
