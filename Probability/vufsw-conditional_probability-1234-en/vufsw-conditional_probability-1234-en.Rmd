Question
========
In a debate competition at a secondary school, half of the participants
were asked to wear a suit, while the other half were asked to wear a
t-shirt. The table below shows how much has been won and lost.  
  

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><br />
</td>
<td>won</td>
<td>lost</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Suit</td>
<td>22</td>
<td>28</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>T-shirt</td>
<td>28</td>
<td>22</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

  
What is the relative risk of losing, in which the participants wearing a
suit are compared with the participants wearing a t-shirt?  
And what is the correct interpretation of this number?

Answerlist
----------
* 1.27; those who wore a suit had a 1.27 times greater chance of losing
  than those wearing a t-shirt.
* 1.27; those who wore a t-shirt had a 1.27 times greater chance of losing
  than those who wore a suit.
* 0.79; those who wore a suit had a 0.79 times greater chance of losing
  than those wearing a t-shirt.
* 0.12; those who wore a t-shirt had a 0.12 times greater chance of losing
  than those who wore a suit.

Solution
========





Chance of losing with suit =0.56 (28/50); chance of losing with t-shirt
=0.44 (22/50). 0.56/0.44=1.27, thus 1.27; those who wore a suit had a
1.27 times greater chance of losing than those wearing a t-shirt.
