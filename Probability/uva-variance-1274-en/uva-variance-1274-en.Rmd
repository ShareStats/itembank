Question
========

Researchers have a taste test to determine whether people can taste whether Cola contains caffeine. We assume that people cannot judge whether caffeine is present. 500 people are randomly chosen as a sample. The answer is coded as X =1 if they say yes, and as X = 0 if they say no. What then is the sample distribution?
