========

Research indicates that the percentage of spam is about 65% of all e-mail is. Define the random variable X as: the number of spam messages in your e-mail box. Suppose you randomly choose two emails, which probability distribution of X below is correct?

Answerlist
----------

* P(X=1) = 0.46; P(X=2) = 0.42
* P(X=0) = 0.12; P(X=1) = 0.46; P(X=2) = 0.42
* P(X=0) = 0.35; P(X=1) = 0.46; P(X=2) = 0.42
