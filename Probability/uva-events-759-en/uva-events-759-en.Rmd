Question
========

$ \begin{aligned} A & = \left \{ x \mid x = 2k, k \in Z \right
\}\\ B & = \left \{ x \mid x = 2k + 1, k \in Z \right \}\\ C
& = \left \{ x \mid x = 2(k + 1), k \in Z \right \}\\ D & =
\left \{ x \mid x = 2k - 1, k \in Z \right \} \end{aligned} $\ Which of these sets are equal to each other?
