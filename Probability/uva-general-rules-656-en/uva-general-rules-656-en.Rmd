Question
========

A factory in Arnhem produces energy-saving light bulbs. The probability of failure is 5%. In a sample we randomly pick two bulbs ***with*** put back. In the following table we see that the number of bulbs *X* that is picked has the following probability distribution:

  ---------------- -------- ------- --- TRUE of *X* 0 1 2 probability 0.9025 0.095 ? ---------------- -------- ------- ---

Here *X* is a random variable. *X* = 0 means that the two lamps are not defective; *X* = 1 means that one of the two is defective; *X*
= 2 means that the two bulbs are both defective. \ What is the probability that both bulbs are defective? Round to four decimal places.

Solution
========

The correct answer is: 0.0025
