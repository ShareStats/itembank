Question
========

Genetics teaches that children inherit genes from their parents. If both parents carry the genes O and A for blood type, each child has a chance of 0.25 to inherit two O genes to become blood type O. The number of children with blood type O among five offspring of these parents is the number of successes *X* in five independent attempts. Suppose that the random variable *X* is the number of children with blood type O. What are then the possible values for X?
