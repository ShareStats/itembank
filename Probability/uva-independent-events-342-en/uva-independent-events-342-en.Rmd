Given the following two assertions about these data:______________. 1: Left-handedness and right-handedness are independent, because P(right-handed ∩ left-handed) = 0. 2: Being artistically well-developed and left-handedness are independent because P(left-handed ∩ artistically well developed) = P(artistically well developed). Which of these statements is correct?
