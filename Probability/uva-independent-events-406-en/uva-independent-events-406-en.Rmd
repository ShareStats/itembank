Question
========

50 Patients are randomly nursed on one of two types of mattresses, and after three days they are assessed for signs of pressure ulcers. (bedsores):

  --------------- ------------------- ------------------------- frequency some pressure ulcers (D) no pressure ulcers (not D) mattress type I 8 12 mattress type II 10 20 --------------- ------------------- -------------------------

We want to know whether pressure ulcer formation is (in)dependent on the mattress type used. mattress type. Indicate which of the following reasoning is correct.

Answerlist
----------

* Dependent, because P(D ∩ I) ≠ 0
* Dependent, because P(D | I) ≠ P(D)
* Independent, because P(D | I) = P(I)
* Independent, because P(D ∪ I) = P(D) + P(I) - P(D ∩ I)

Solution
========

Answerlist
----------

* Dependent, because P(D ∩ I) ≠ 0: Incorrect
* Dependent, because P(D | I) ≠ P(D): Correct
* Independent, because P(D | I) = P(I): Incorrect
* Independent, because P(D ∪ I) = P(D) + P(I) - P(D ∩ I): Incorrect
