Also, the physical activity behavior (AG) was measured and classified into three classes classified: 1 = rarely, 2 = sometimes, 3 = regularly. The results are shown in cross tabulation below:

  ------------- -------- -------- -------- frequencies SB = 1 SB = 2 SB = 3 AG = 1 4 12 14 AG = 2 13 25 12 AG = 3 8 8 4 ------------- -------- -------- --------

For these 100 people, what is the size of P(SB =3 AG = 3)?
