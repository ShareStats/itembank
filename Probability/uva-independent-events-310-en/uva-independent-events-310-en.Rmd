Question
========

Of two events A and B, the following is given: P(A) = 0.60, P(B) = 0.40, P(A ∩ B) = 0.20 and P(A ∪ B) = 0.80. Are events A and B independent?

Answerlist
----------

* Yes, because P(A ∪ B)= P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)
* Yes, because P(B | A) = P(B)
* No, because P(A ∩ B) ≠ P(A) x P(B)
* No, because P(A ∪ B) ≠ P(A) + P(B)

Solution

Answerlist
----------

* Yes, because P(A ∪ B)= P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B): Incorrect
* Yes, because P(B | A) = P(B): Incorrect
* No, because P(A ∩ B) ≠ P(A) x P(B): Correct
* No, because P(A ∪ B) ≠ P(A) + P(B): Incorrect
