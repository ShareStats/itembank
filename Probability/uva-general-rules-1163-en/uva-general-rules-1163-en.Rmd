========

Research indicates that the percentage of spam is about 60% of all e-mail is. Define the random variable X as: the number of spam messages in your e-mail box. Suppose you randomly choose two emails, which probability distribution of X below is correct?

Answerlist
----------

* P(X=1) = 0.48; P(X=2) = 0.36
* P(X=0) = 0.16; P(X=1) = 0.48; P(X=2) = 0.36
* P(X=0) = 0.40; P(X=1) = 0.60; P(X=2) = 0.60
