Question
========

A sample of 200 people are asked for a prediction of the outcome of the European Cup soccer match Netherlands-Germany (win for the Netherlands, draw, loss for the Netherlands). The gender gender of the respondent is also noted. The results are shown in cross tabulation below:

  ------- ------- ------------ --------- ----- Win Draw Draw Loss Male 40 30 50 120 Woman 40 10 30 80 80 40 80 200 ------- ------- ------------ --------- -----

In this sample were 120 men and 80 women; 80 of them predicted a win for the Dutch national team, 40 a draw and 80 loss. If gender and prediction were independent, how many men predicting a win would you expect based on these numbers?
