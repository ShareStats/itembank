========

The probability distribution of blood groups in the Netherlands is as follows: P(O) = 0.38; P(B) = 0.33; P(A) = 0.20; P(AB) = 0.09. In Belgium, the probability distribution is: P(O) = 0.34; P(B) = 0.29; P(A) = 0.24; P(AB) = 0.13. What is the probability that both a randomly selected blood donor from Belgium and a randomly selected blood donor from the Netherlands does *not* have blood group A has?
