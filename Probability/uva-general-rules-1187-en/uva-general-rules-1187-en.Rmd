Question
========

Every morning, Daan rolls a clean die. If he throws a 1 or 2 then he goes to play soccer. If he throws a 3, 4, 5 or 6 then he goes running. Suppose the random variable is X: the number of days that Daan goes running. What is the probability distribution that out of the next five days he is going to run at least three of them?

Answerlist
----------

* P(X=3) = 0.3275
* P(X=4) = 0.3325
* P(X≥3) = P(X=4)+P(X=5)=0.3325+0.1350
* P(X ≥3) = P(X=3)+P(X=4)+P(X=5)=0.3275+0.3325+0.1350= 0.7950
