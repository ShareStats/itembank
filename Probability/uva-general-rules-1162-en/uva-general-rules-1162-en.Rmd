Question
========

Research indicates that the percentage of spam is about 70% of all e-mail is. Define the random variable *X* as: the number of spam messages in your e-mail box. Suppose you randomly choose two emails, which probability distribution of *X* below is correct?

Answerlist
----------

* P(X=1) = 0.42; P(X=2) = 0.49
* P(X=0) = 0.09; P(X=1) = 0.42; P(X=2) = 0.49
* P(X=1) = 0.30; P(X=2) = 0.70
* P(X=0) = 0.30; P(X=1) = 0.70; P(X=2) = 0.70
