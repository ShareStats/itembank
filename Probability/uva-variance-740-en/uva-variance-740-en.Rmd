Question
========

MIT typically selects a few students each year who are eligible eligible for a prestigious award. Because very strict selection, each year the number of chosen students who qualify eligible for the award. The distribution of X, the number of selected students eligible each year, is as following:

  ------------------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ Number of students 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Chance 0.01 0.11 0.18 0.25 0.23 0.11 0.07 0.04 ------------------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------

What is the expected value and standard deviation of X?
