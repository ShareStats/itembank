Question
========

Suppose you drill a hole and then measure it. We define the event *A* if the diameter of the hole is larger than 2.3 cm and smaller than 2.5 cm. What then is the complement event of *A*, if
$\bar{A}$?

Answerlist
----------

* $\bar{A}$ = {the diameter of the hole is less than 2.3 cm}
* $\bar{A}$ = {the diameter of the hole is greater than 2.5 cm}
* $\bar{A}$ = {the diameter of the hole is greater than 4.8 cm}
* $\bar{A}$ = {the diameter of the hole is less than 2.3 cm or greater than 2.5 cm}
