Question
========

In a randomly drawn sample of 200 independent individuals, we looked at the occurrence of RSI complaints (none, mild, severe) and the type of work (much computer work, other).

  ----------- ---------------- -------------- ------- --------- yes RSI complaints None Mild Serious Type of work Much computer 18 14 8 Other 120 32 8 ----------- ---------------- -------------- ------- ---------

Define A as the event "No RSI symptoms" and B as the event "Lots of computer work." Then

Answerlist
----------

* A and B are dependent because P(A ∩ B) ≠ P(B | A)
* A and B are dependent because P(A) ≠ P(B | A)
* A and B are dependent because P(A) ≠ P(A | B)
* A and B are dependent because P(A∪B) ≠ P(A) x P(B)
