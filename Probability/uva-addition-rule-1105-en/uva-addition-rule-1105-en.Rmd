Jody is taking three courses: English, History and Mathematics. Assume the probability that she will get an 8 in each course at the end of the semester:â€– \ P(grade 8 on the English exam) = 0.70. P(grade 8 on the History exam) = 0.60. P(grade 8 on the math exam) = 0.50. \ The events are independent of each other. Then what is the probability that Jody will get an 8 for only one subject?
