Question
========
The magazine 'Cosmopolitan' suggests that women who skip breakfast have
a greater chance of being pregnant with a girl, while women who do have
breakfast are more likely to be pregnant with a boy. To test this, we
took a sample of pregnant women who were already familiar with the sex
of their child. We asked them about the sex of their baby and whether or
not they had breakfast every day. Given that a woman does have
breakfast, what is the likelihood of a boy?

Answerlist
----------
* The number that gets a boy and **not** had breakfast / the number that
  gets a boy and had breakfast.
* The number that gets a boy and had breakfast / the number that had
  breakfast.
* The number that gets a boy and had breakfast / the number that gets a
  boy receives and **not** had breakfast.
* The number that gets a boy and had breakfast / the number that **not**
  had breakfast.
